But T-minus eight weeks counting April 14 , obsessively tracked TV show history returns final run , time start getting back “ Game Thrones ” mind-set . This newsletter help . What need ? An epic binge Seasons 1-7 ? A compact refresher characters , events themes ? How ? We ’ worked Citadel-worthy crash course got ’ stake , end nigh . We ’ take different season Monday April 14 , in-depth follow-ups every Friday . This week Season 1 . When ’ trying get High Sparrow ’ good side , Cersei tells faith crown two pillars hold world . But , really ? Until Cersei stupidly reinstated Faith Militant , much authority religious figures really Westeros ? Certainly Faith Seven dominant religion — High Septon officiant coronations , royal weddings ceremonies , noble households septas help raise daughters . ( R.I.P. , Septa Mordane . ) But recent years , Faith ’ really flex muscles . It ignored Targaryen incest ; nothing execution committed Sept Baelor ; seems absent trials combat , purportedly held “ let gods decide. ” And King ’ Landing riot Season 2 , people choose rip apart limb limb ? The High Septon . The people — gods — spoken . The High Septon High Sparrow much authority crown allows . The true another religious figure : Melisandre continue burning people alive name Lord Light long Stannis allows . She needs permission , see must ask burn Shireen Baratheon . Stannis hesitates first , great leap — previously allowed red priestess burn “ infidels , ” political prisoners in-laws . And start realize Season 5 , ’ even preaching gospel Red Temple . Another vampy red priestess Volantis heralds Dany — Stannis — Chosen One . Mel ’ even support rest Team R ’ hllor . The Red Temple might foothold Essos , Westeros , power , shall say , limited . In terms actual power , death cult House Black White Braavos might reign supreme : They dependent one monarch , one leader represent . The Many-Faced God many wealthy patrons , prefer remain anonymous . Should wish topple government , let ’ say , ask Faceless Men kill someone one wiser . The Iron Bank Braavos would certainly well-positioned use service ruler defaulted loan . Or could throw support ruler ’ enemies , Stannis still backing Lannisters . At least House Black White ’ try impose masses . ( Only targets . ) In “ Game Thrones , ” real world , ’ always best careful wish . Viserys Targaryen wanted crown , one got killed . We talked actor Harry Lloyd death scene Season 1 . ( Adapted interview earlier article . ) Did read fan reaction character ’ death ? I read sorts stuff filmed . So I knew moment thought actually going get crown crucial moment people , I wanted make sure landed . So helpful . The death always part parcel character — indignant young man , desperate king , gets happy boy second , ironically gets molten gold “ crown ” poured head . It one exciting things getting play . What ’ favorite memory last day set ? I remember funny chat director technically kills molten metal poured skull . We talked point liquid would penetrate skull touch brain , body temperature , heart rate . But course , came , I screamed like girl said cut . Who favorite death ? For reason , Jory Cassel ’ death Season 1 always stayed . The way Jaime stabbed eye looked Ned Stark . Chilling . Either , Khal Drogo killing Mago . I remember Jason Momoa filling scene filmed ferry Malta shooting . It written duel , Jason said Drogo ’ first kill much spectacular . He described ’ insisted Drogo throw away weapons ’ got art department create tongue could rip Mago ’ throat instead . Which agreed ! And listening talk , I knew sure show something , cool .

And ’ , ’ brief rundown everything know Season 8 far : It big ! Season 8 , Episode 1 , ‘ Winterfell ’ On Sunday , finally returned era-defining show , gone years , captivated world high-stakes melodrama woven familiar human fallibility . That show “ Downton Abbey. ” Because long-awaited Season 8 premiere “ Game Thrones , ” grand royal arrival onward , Winterfell resembled nothing much great Edwardian manse swollen emotion . Charged reunions , new conflicts old grudges played upstairs downstairs , inside , siblings exes , old friends in-laws , much rippling outward haughty noblewoman one liked much . Granted , I ’ recall Lady Mary ever incinerating anyone ’ brother , Daenerys poor Dickon Tarly last season . And instead dowager countess ’ bon mots , got Bran , sitting creeping everybody . Overall somewhat soapy generally satisfying setup final run “ Game Thrones , ” sides coalesced wars come . Jon Dany ’ coalition living currently includes nearly everyone named sleeping Cersei . She heads King ’ Landing faction , week welcomed mysterious new man — Capt . Strickland , leader Golden Company — onto team Euron bed , inviting speculation purported pregnancy departed Jaime . In chaos following Tywin Lannister ’ death , many characters attempt take control , often face intransigent foes — religious fanatics , political insurgents , armies dead . Trying pick apart intricate plot ? Thinking along themes settings might help . Hero Logic Two knights set rescue princess Dorne . Never mind ’ feisty love ’ want go home . ( She , though — life danger ways ’ understand . ) A would-be knight squire set rescue princess North ; refuses aid well . Both rescue attempts fail first , later sort succeed — ’ late , unfortunately . ( Myrcella gets poisoned ; Sansa gets raped . ) These things happen time Westeros ( Essos ) , characters determined save people whole classes people , even countries . “ Westeros needs saved , ” Varys says . Jon Snow , action hero ever one , wants save wildlings prevent becoming soldiers Night King ’ army . But Free Folk waste valuable time arguing , Night King minions roll . Thousands people die ( thus qualifying join army dead ) . The dragonglass lost . The Night ’ Watch — thrilled Jon ’ bringing surviving wildlings Wall — decides kill . Rescue attempts succeed simply rescuer honorable intentions . After Dany takes first flight Drogon , people decide needs rescue rescue . Why occur one world maybe ’ — maybe one save ? Proxy Power What need dirty deed done ’ ? In Westeros Essos , ’ simple : Use proxy ! Hire Faceless Man assassinate anyone like make look like accident . Deploy Sons Harpy mount violent protests abolition ( popular idea among former slave masters ) . Or empower Sparrows ( Faith Militant ) simply arrest enemies . Using proxy added advantage affording degree anonymity — something shadowy organizations also prize . The Sons Harpy go masked terrorist excursions . The Faceless Men require acolytes give belongings names . And Sparrows must surrender worldly possessions well , even shoes . The High Sparrow maintains prudent distance violence done name , allowing put kindly avuncular mask . Of course , Night King ultimate master proxies — ’ able compel masses dead bidding . He ’ even ask ( pay ) . Sally On Side Sex big deal show ’ form power . That ’ Margaery crows consummating marriage king — sex makes queen . Sex outside marriage even bigger deal season , brothels become key part political landscape . Littlefinger ’ brothel , managed male prostitute Olyvar , raided Sparrows , twice . The first time High Septon enjoys services , second shut place make statement ’ charge King ’ Landing . And let ’ forget Olyvar ’ relationship Loras Tyrell means spying Littlefinger Cersei . Even though Littlefinger also facilitates highborn marriage arrangements , ’ forget actually pimp . ( Or flesh-peddler , Lancel calls . Whichever prefer . ) Love stories “ Game Thrones ” tend end rather badly — lover dying arms , pushing Moon Door , strangling golden chain . We talked actor Sibel Kekilli sad standoff Tyrion Shae Season 4 . ( Adapted earlier interview Kekilli . ) How find character ’ death ? Dan Weiss David Benioff told role would slightly different original character books , bit bigger . But I ’ read books point , I clue exactly meant . When I told friends I going show , spoiled whole thing , big-time . I actually thought going kill end Season 3 , reading scripts season , I asked Dan David changed minds decided put Shae throne end ? Unfortunately , answer . But gave good news character would live one season . So least nice surprise . What remember last day set ? My last day set actually strangulation scene Peter Dinklage , I rather sad time “ Game Thrones ” come end . But I thought really kind Dan David came another set watch die . Did read fan reaction ? Unfortunately , I . Apparently people really mean days , ’ differentiate fictional character real person . What bothered fact people ’ believe Shae really love Tyrion . But I ’ happy also could way around . I met Barack Obama , said , “ I sorry killed , ” big ironic smile . He kind charming . And George R.R . Martin told known earlier , ’ killed . He liked Shae better one books . How show change career ? It ’ bit crazy scary time . Sometimes I get recognized show , even though since I series . Sometimes ’ really funny , think know somewhere met . And find I played Shae show , immediately say , “ Ah ! You betrayed Tyrion ! ” Who favorite death ? Viserys ’ death memorable , impact . And sorry say , Joffrey ’ death good — horrible king , death scene magnificent . The final season “ Game Thrones ” arrives April 14 . Before , ’ getting prepared rewatching first seven seasons .

Ellaria Sand Sand Snakes violently overthrow Dorne take control , even though Ellaria ’ next line . And — — legal basis Queen Mother take throne following death king ’ last supposed heir . Then , Cersei already thumbed nose line succession placing kids born twincest Iron Throne , could rule ( try ) . And ’ willing blow anyone challenges . She kills Faith Militant , Tyrells members Small Council , hundreds nobles present attend trial . Qyburn , effect , becomes second powerful member court , replacing Hand , Small Council High Septon . Who ’ left ask Citadel check royal family trees ? Luckily , Bran ’ got much archive head . Near Death Experiences The Many-Faced God like lives stolen , lot characters defy death anyway . The Three-Eyed Raven claims lived thousand years . Melisandre , ’ revealed , also lived lot longer previously thought , possibly hundreds years . Both Beric Dondarrion Jon Snow resurrected dead — Beric times Jon , followers Lord Light . In sense , Euron Greyjoy also died brought back life hands priest , time serving Drowned God ( drowning Kingsmoot baptism coronation ) . Benjen lives in-between state — mostly dead , still less dead reanimated Mountain , less dead White Walkers ’ wights . Death clearly last word world , might Davos risks life request Jon ’ resurrection first place . Although ’ known done , done others ? Certainly , would cut many funerals always taking place . Cersei ’ world seems defined funerals . We first met Jon Arryn ’ body lying state Sept Baelor Season 1 , ’ steady toll dead piling around ever since . Almost every season features funeral Sept Baelor — wonder wants blow place smithereens . How much grief one person bear ? And hatred Tyrion stems grief , believes responsible deaths mother son . Others grieve different ways , course . Trystane Martell prefers paint little eyes stones Myrcella ’ service , Ramsay takes moment remember Myranda feeding precious dogs ( rite repeated ) . And Dothraki always expect widows grieve forever , locked away Temple Dosh Khaleen , Dany ends practice . It ’ Dany defy death Dothraki kneel , goddess . Jon ’ people , least , illusions leader . ‘ There ’ need battle. ’ Sometimes ’ possible avoid death settling conflict ; sometimes , ’ . That scene show Dany steps temple , emerging flames naked unburnt ? That set firestorm fans , even though scene ’ yet happened books , went George R.R . Martin said previously . Dany survives Khal Drogo ’ funeral pyre ( possibly aided witch Mirri Maz Duur ) , even fire burns Khaleesi ’ hair away . And Dany around fire-breathing Drogon , burns hair yet gives burns blisters . Dany also somewhat afraid Drogon . “ If I run , burn devour , ” thinks , good reason . “ TARGARYENS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO FIRE , ” Martin explained webchat ( caps ) . In another interview , clarified : “ No Targaryens immune fire . The thing Dany dragons , one-time magical event. ” Bran ’ greenseeing reveries also limit . Greenseeing kind warging , except ’ linking network tree consciousness . The heart trees — trees carved faces — spiritual CCTV surveillance cameras around Westeros , greenseers using godswoods became gods , gaining sort omniscience . The trees ’ share sense time humans — database covers past , present future . But trees available help Bran see vast majority visions Season 6 . Bran ’ visions books augmented becoming tree — rather , eating white paste red streaks look like blood , said come weirwood seeds ( believed actually blood Jojen Reed ) . As show , Bran starts discover reach people past visions . When says , “ Winterfell , ” Ned looks . “ Who ’ ? ” asks . But Bran ’ voice sounds like whisper wind , rustle leaves . Theon hears wind whisper “ Theon ” ’ godswood , ’ therapeutic . ( “ Let die Theon , Reek , ” prays . ) “ Words wind ” common phrase Westeros — common Martin ’ editor tried get cut number times ’ used books . Martin refused , though , possibly connection words wind foreshadowing larger part story yet come . Bran ’ Stark magical abilities , developed . Both Jon Arya able warg direwolves , mostly though think “ wolf dreams. ” The direwolves also share telepathic link sort , connection could benefit humans , Stark kids learn master abilities . In books , Arya gets boost blind Braavos , much less attacked sticks ( show ) developing senses . Instead getting kicked House Black White , Arya continues classes . A cat follows one night , eyes , able cheat midterm earn sight back . Both Bran Arya taking beginner ’ magic , sort . The advanced Melisandre studied long ago , pays price using powers form physical pain . ( The ruby throat burns . Blood trickles thighs , black smoking . ) Euron Greyjoy , , practitioner dark magic books . He ’ merely seek marriage alliance Dany , wants Season 6 ; plans bind dragons . He magical horn purpose , requires blood , — whoever blows die . Recipients magic also suffer . Jon Snow ’ resurrection ’ happened books yet , Beric Dondarrion ’ experience gives us preview — resurrected dead consequences . Beric loses memories feels less time . When happens Jon Snow books , ’ recover quickly show . The War Five Kings lost one king remains full swing , three seven kingdoms open rebellion . Plots place remove another king board end season , many plots , counterplots , untrustworthy types lurking , ’ hard keep track . Focusing might help : Calling Child Protective Services An awful lot children Westeros Essos get mistreated — molested , murdered , sold sacrificed ( learn daughter-raping Craster done 99 sons , would done 100th , Gilly ’ baby ) . Some 8,000 newborns killed Astapor slave masters wanted prove eunuch soldiers sense empathy . Other children orphaned parents killed one another war . Few kids fend — Stark children survive primarily guardians step take care . ( The Hound ’ bad babysitter ! ) We ’ know yet kind parental substitutes White Walkers , ’ figure better Craster . ( They least show interest . ) No wonder Dany develops savior complex — many children brutal world desperately need saving . Spy vs. Spy Spies everywhere . Jon Snow goes undercover Free Folk defector ( ’ fully fool ) . Varys convinces Ros spy Littlefinger ( perhaps lured , looking spill valuable info boss ’ travel plans ) . Varys tries thwart Littlefinger plotting Tyrells , Littlefinger ’ prostitute Olyvar easily seduces Loras Tyrell reports back . Key bit intel : Loras set marry … someone . Littlefinger concludes someone Sansa alerts Lannisters , leading Tywin ’ strategic matchmaking Cersei Loras Tyrion Sansa , none happy . ( Littlefinger gives Ros Joffrey , ’ end well . ) Even though Jorah Mormont longer spy , ’ clearly worried new Team Dany member Barristan Selmy knows , could use fact . And ultimate spymaster Westeros , course , Three-Eyed Raven , recruits Jojen Reed Bran Stark mysterious purposes . At least Jon , Ros , Olyvar Jorah know risks espionage : Bran idea ’ store . ( “ The raven ” count . ) Red Wedding RSVPs When plans Red Wedding coalesce ? The Frey alliance Starks tatters end Season 2 , ’ plan alone . When Tywin Lannister get action ? Clues come early Season 3 , embarks correspondence spree . ( Notice Tyrion Cersei come visit , preoccupied writing letters ) . Tywin ’ first missives would likely Freys , want revenge Starks end war Riverlands . 1 . Bran Stark Odds : 2.2:1 How Bran favorite ? He ’ fight even carry functional conversation — could possibly beat everyone else throne ? But ’ also argument favor show consistently striven surprise ? Bran ’ egoless omniscience could realm needs years toxically self-interested vindictive leadership . All hail King Three-Eye , first name . 2 . Jon Snow Odds : 3.5:1 Jon New England Patriots contest : The obvious favorite boring choice . But Patriots lost many Super Bowls ’ . 3 . Sansa Stark Odds : 5:1 Once one feckless people story , Sansa might actually best equipped rule Seven Kingdoms point . But given things went last time King ’ Landing , would want go back ? The case favor : She ’ shown desire lead , interactions Jon Winterfell , ice-cold ’ called , executions Ramsay Littlefinger . 4 . Daenerys Targaryen Odds : 7:1 She dragons strongest power , aside perhaps irredeemably doomed Cersei . But ’ also shown enough father ’ crazy streak make wonder ’ self-destruct wins big prize . 5 . Gendry Odds : 7:1 He rowed like four years guns prove . His Baratheon blood also gives decent claim throne . But really going give guy ’ maybe 11 minutes screen time ? 6 . Littlefinger Odds : 10:1 Wait , ’ say ’ executed ? A theory making rounds online maintains man saw Arya kill Season 7 finale actually Littlefinger , Faceless Man hired take place . ( Exhibit A brief scene Season 7 gives woman coin , like Arya fled Braavos . ) Stranger things happened show , I guess . At rate , interest apparently strong enough get board . 7 . The Night King Odds : 10:1 The popular choice among nihilists environmentalists gone all-in White-Walkers-as-climate-change metaphor . But George R.R . Martin said ending “ bittersweet , ” “ weird deflating . '' 8 . Tyrion Lannister Odds : 10:1 He 's come long way drinking knowing things days . But ’ final act moral awakening seem destined noble , gut-wrenching sacrifice ? 9 . Jonerys offspring named later Odds : 14:1 The Season 7 finale suggested Dany might get pregnant nephew Jon 's child , bloodline , tyke would one powerful people story . But based reigns Joffrey Tommen , show seems take dim view incest baby rulers . 10 . Arya Stark Odds : 16:1 She ’ fighter ruler . 11 . Samwell Tarly Odds : 20:1 He ’ writer ruler . That ’ Cersei . Standing map , sees clearly deep trouble ’ . Enemies east — Dany Dragonstone . Enemies south — Ellaria Sand Dornish rebels . Enemies west — Olenna Tyrell Reach . Enemies north — Starks Northern lords . Isolated debt , Cersei realizes needs allies , enlists Euron Greyjoy fleet . She also wages PR war , hammering home argument Dany like father , Mad King , deposed , ’ foreign invader , leading army savages . She tells people Dothraki burn villages ground ( never mind Cersei burned Sept ground ) . She ’ need create fake news — Dany ’ past behavior enough make Cersei sound like better option . But even new allies ’ able recruit — Greyjoy fleet , Tarlys Reach — Cersei still ’ numbers . What side , though , element surprise . Euron Greyjoy ambushes rebel Greyjoy fleet sailing Dragonstone Sunspear . Perhaps Dany ’ war council looked map setting sail Meereen , might decided land Sunspear first , way predictable destination Dragonstone . If Dany willing skip symbolic move landing place born , might still fleet . The Lannisters ’ next surprise involves emptying Casterly Rock relocating majority forces Highgarden . Casterly Rock , empty goldmines , ’ counted much ages — except Tyrion , sees inheritance using Dany take . ( Did learn stint Master Coin mined ? ) So ’ perfect bait Tyrion , decides split Dany ’ forces stage two operations opposite sides Westeros , near hostile waters . Why see map ? Why one suggest use dragons aerial reconnaissance ? Tyrion ’ plan built avoiding perception Dany foreign invader , embracing , wearing like armor . They could fuse ground , air naval forces , demonstrate united coalition . When Dany takes matters hands rethinks tactics , finally wins battle . Dany ’ M.O . Slaver ’ Bay play liberator — extreme violence , could argue , warranted tyrannical oppressors . And Cersei , tyrant ? But Dany ’ speech survivors loot-train attack makes sound like another tyrant : Bend knee join . Refuse die . How breaking wheel ? No wonder Randyll Dickon Tarly opt . As Tyrion keeps trying point , would better offer possibilities — imprisonment , Night ’ Watch , even exile . Give people Westeros real choice . Killing Tarlys reinforces Dany ’ dreadful rep. Dany ’ biggest mistakes , , include failing seek swift decisive victory ; failing neutralize weaker enemy ; failing listen Yara , military experience ; failing engage necessary battle public relations ; failing give Houses reason rally behind ; failing think beyond limited binary constructs . She thinks either villain hero — queen ashes hope better world . Use dragons burn cities , use — never considers ways press advantage . She could fly directly Red Keep target Cersei — Cersei — surgical strike . Do flyovers impress intimidate — incinerate — rest nobility . Use Dothraki prevent Lannister army leaving King ’ Landing . Or consider economic diplomatic strategies , way Cersei . Dany ’ next mistake , underestimating Night King Cersei , agree wight hunt , risk three dragons rescue operation limited intel . She focused taking Cersei equation . Instead , Dany falls yet another trap hands powerful weapon enemy creative ways use dragon At Winterfell , Sansa ’ asking local farmers help build grain stores regular shipments , planning ahead feed armies North local refugees . “ If entire North flee Winterfell , ’ enough time bring wagon loads grain , ” reasons . At King ’ Landing , Lannisters ’ asking farmers food — ’ stealing . Part Cersei Jaime ’ Highgarden scheme get gold repay Iron Bank , also empty granaries collect harvests farms Reach . Which kind warfare : The capital hopes withstand long siege , people Reach ’ able survive long winter . Listen background chatter Inn Crossroads Arya reunites Hot Pie . Two men speculate “ prices triple ” mean prices food King ’ Landing . Remember Bronn explained Tyrion Varys Season 2 ? “ The thieves , love siege . Soon gates sealed , steal food . By time ’ , ’ richest men town. ” Noble women sell diamonds sack potatoes . If gets really bad , Bronn says , poor start eat . “ Food ’ worth gold. ” Realizing ’ able feed armies “ Cersei taken food , ” Dany decides hit back . Instead attacking King ’ Landing , attacks loot train , though Drogon blasts wagons containing grain food supplies . Now one precious resource . Starvation one biggest threats Westeros . This partly farmer Hound revisits Season 7 killed daughter . When Hound robbed silver Season 4 , estimating would dead come winter , ensured fate . With without war , food prices skyrocket . Clear Present Danger Jon Snow trying recruit allies fight army dead , ’ trouble rallying people cause . It might ’ great describing White Walker experiences using witnesses corroborate . Perhaps Jon needs think back Night ’ Watch back Season 1 , sent Alliser Thorne letter wight hand show Small Council . ( The Small Council saw letter Season 2 — Thorne , hand . ) It ’ curious Tyrion ’ bring , since one read letter tried vouch Lord Commander Jeor Mormont ’ credibility . But perhaps incident gives Tyrion idea go beyond Wall capture wight first place . Tyrion thinks would provide proof Cersei , also remember past dealings ’ going care . It ’ Cersei needs information anyway — ’ realm . Sam realizes makes case Citadel , Archmaester Ebrose , complacent , believes . But maesters ’ moved action Sam tries convince spread word . His mistake telling Citadel maesters ask various lords send men defend Wall time war . Then ’ issue witness tampering . Podrick tells Tyrion offered knighthood would testify Tyrion bought poison . Someone else ( Cersei ? Tywin ? ) got Shae . It ’ twisted trail aligns Olenna Tyrell ’ Littlefinger ’ frame-job . Two weeks wedding , Olenna claims unhappy necklace presented Margaery wear , tells group Tyrell women go speak jewelers King ’ Landing find best necklace town . What ’ really looking , course , best poison container , since Strangler comes crystallized form . You may recognize : It stuff Maester Cressen popped wine share Melisandre Season 2 . But Margaery ’ seen wearing necklace , Olenna — Littlefinger ’ help — recruits someone else easy reach reception . Perhaps murderers hoped make murder look Joffrey simply choked death , fallback , also set Sansa Tyrion likely suspects . Why else Dontos whisk Sansa away soon Joffrey starts choking ? Why else throw used necklace onto Dontos ’ dead body , assuring could found later , instead water ? Though Olenna Littlefinger made Sansa look guilty , also guarantee would escape punishment . Tyrion , however , much . Even though recognizes ’ framed , Tyrion ’ connect latest betrayal last time Littlefinger framed . After , Littlefinger alibi time . Littlefinger ’ Lessons Littlefinger wants Sansa multiple levels — ’ key North , reminds mother ’ pupil never . Although ’ imparted bit information past seasons , really starts confiding escape boat trip ( , becomes vulnerable ) . While ’ partners Joffrey ’ murder outright , drops strong enough hint ( “ grow strong , ” referring House Tyrell ’ words “ growing strong ” ) . He admits killing Joffrey , kills Lysa Sansa witness . He teaches trust anyone . He shows devious , incorporating truth , twisting ever slightly , displaying real emotions give lie force proclaiming tell truth ’ good deception anyway . ( As Sansa defends Lysa , “ says I ’ stupid little girl , I ’ stupid little girl never learns ! And I ’ terrible liar ! ” ) Sansa gets lot mileage terrible liar ( Littlefinger recognizes end Season 2 ) . By lying lords ladies Vale using little reverse psychology , Sansa lines protectors corner , especially Lord Royce , friend father ( likely grew Ned Stark fostered Eyrie ) . More important , Sansa leverage Littlefinger always play “ murdered Aunt Lysa ” card later . When Sansa wore necklace given Dontos , still susceptible romance fairy tales . When switches large black buckle chain necklace Dark Sansa mode , ’ announcing ’ outgrown notions ready game-player right . Expensive Gifts “ Nothing like thoughtful gift make new friendship grow strong , ” Littlefinger says . Of course , ’ referring “ gift ” murdering Joffrey , rather pricey present . Gifts rich meaning , often signifying much giver recipient , Lysa becomes suspicious crates lemons Littlefinger ships Eyrie , Sansa snack beloved lemon cakes . Daario offers Dany flowers — way romantic schooling strategy . Dany gives people Meereen broken chains necks former slaves encourage revolt , turn , deliver city . Tywin gives freshly forged sword Valyrian steel Jaime entice forsake vow Kingsguard Lannister heir . Jaime gives Brienne , along armor squire , enable fulfill vow . Her calling sword “ Oathkeeper ” signifies understands . ( It perhaps one truest , selfless gifts , acknowledged . ) Never cross Machiavellian mastermind . The prostitute-turned-madam-turned-spy Ros learned hard way , Littlefinger gave Joffrey use target practice new crossbow . ( It payback thwarting arrangements Sansa . ) Instead camera lingering Joffrey makes first direct kill , pans Ros ’ trussed-up , already dead body Littlefinger ’ now-famous “ chaos ladder ” speech . We pay respects actress Esmé Bianco . ( Adapted interview earlier article . ) How find character ’ death ? I knew I Season 3 , I thought strange ’ sent scripts . Then I got email assistant [ showrunners ] David Benioff Dan Weiss , saying wanted conference call . At point , I like , “ Ah , ’ good news. ” I knew I living borrowed time , I amazed I survived long I , really . The call like awkward breakup . They timid breaking news , eventually I like , “ Guys , calling ? ” They told I going die , ’ tell . They sent script next day , I like , “ Seriously ? Why ’ tell phone Joffrey killed ? ” I angry ! Why ? Getting killed Joffrey insulting ’ little [ expletive ] , excuse French . He ’ little twerp . Of characters killed ? And I really infuriated I ’ get die screen . Nothing ’ fun great screen death ! I begged set , “ Can ’ I final cough sputter ? ” And like , “ Nope , ’ dead. ” “ Please ? ” “ Nope , ’ dead. ” Did read fan reaction ? Did help hurt ? My character kind controversial Ros ’ appear books , lot die-hard fans would time many seconds I spent screen per episode . They absolutely hated Season 1 . So I stopped reading social media , upset much . People seriously mean . I ’ know people could horrible ! Did check social media death ? I sworn secrecy , I ’ tell anybody . But I tricked friends invited : “ It ’ Cinco de Mayo , I ’ party , ’ also ‘ Game Thrones ’ night , watch , too. ” Almost like ’ afterthought . I wanted friends around death scene Twitter reactions . And absolutely insane . I ’ keep tweets ! I surprised huge reaction . I ’ one main characters , ’ one iconic deaths people expecting books . And people reacting , “ Oh , died , ” , “ It looked gross. ” People really upset ! That really moving . So worked ! [ Laughs ] Maybe ’ ’ many characters “ Game Thrones ” average person streets . Who favorite death ? I think Joffrey one , satisfying . [ Laughs ] Obviously , I personal reasons enjoying watching Joffrey die . But seeing Catelyn Stark ’ reaction Red Wedding , scream lets ? I get goose bumps thinking . It also changed reason Robb Stark throws away alliance Freys , , know , leads sorts trouble others . In “ A Clash Kings , ” wounded Robb learns Theon ’ purported execution younger brothers Bran Rickon . In anguish , Robb receives “ comfort ” ( i.e . sex ) young noblewoman tending wounds castle conquered . This perhaps understandable lapse judgment , youth ( ’ even younger books ) , grief state mind ( ’ feverish might given milk poppy ) . The problem , Jeyne ’ prostitute commoner — ’ lord ’ daughter . So Robb honor-bound marry . Robb faces ethical dilemma . This dating game , choosing possibly ugly Frey behind door No . 1 winsome Westerling behind door No . 2 . It ’ actually choice protecting honor protecting someone else ’ . Since ’ Ned Stark ’ son , tries protect someone else , even though could end misery . And sure enough , book-Robb makes tragic mistake leads many deaths , including . TV Robb ’ facing ethical dilemma — ’ disregarding honor entirely . He actively pursues young woman , finds beautiful intriguing , even though ’ already committed arranged marriage . He chooses spend time could sorting troop movements , perusing battle plans seeking counsel top lieutenant ( slight Roose Bolton ’ forget , leads participation Red Wedding ) . Even Catelyn warns son away battlefield hookups ’ betrothed another , Robb continues flirting Talisa . Because presented love story , ’ supposed root young lovers . And ’ Talisa great catch — smart , sassy , good amputations ? Best , ’ taking sides ugly war . Or ? In books , Robb ’ marriage Jeyne little suspicious — , quite possibly , setup . The Westerlings may privy entirety Red Wedding plans , sort “ understanding ” Tywin , included making sure Robb conceive heir new bride .

And I snarked Twitter “ porn-y side Game Thrones helps keeps liberals deluded like show , ” letting tell , “ Oh , I like ’ deconstructing patriarchal pre-modern world showing ’ sex power way down. ” But , liberals : “ You like lets escape flat dreariness liberalism little . Because deep want king queen. ” So little bit provoking , people predictably quite provoked , Twitter I exaggerating effect probably got responses I deserved — also gaining new appreciation perverse pleasures rightsplaining beloved forms pop culture liberal fans . But I also got responses worth arguing briefly , I think reflect kind strong misreading Martin ’ story show offering . I ’ thinking particularly one Brian Phillips , fine sports-and-culture writer formerly Grantland MTV ; I ’ take liberty stringing Phillips ’ tweets mini-essay : To say Game Thrones attractive liberals secret monarchical longings , ignore…everything GoT . GoT make Stark bannerman Daenerys retainer look fun ! Those people get flayed beheaded ! GoT presents vision monarchy exaggeratedly dystopian even compared historical reality monarchy . I think dystopian exaggeration fact key show ’ appeal liberals many ways . It lets fantasize negation principles simultaneously confirming rightness . GoT presents vision world illiberal instincts freely indulged , id constrained physical power . All violent , nasty stuff liberal society ( thankfully ) ’ let us , ’ still seething lizard brains , gets acted . And acted — violence brutality organizing principles world based . But dystopianism comes , show chides harboring fantasies helps gratify . It wallows destructive consequences — makes wallowing , fact , simultaneous fulfillment fantasies . Will power leads suffering chaos , lead opportunities power acted upon , etc . This vastly complex interesting emotional appeal “ people secretly want kings. ” The liberal order always implicitly upheld accommodation base desire opposite . To , interesting ongoing thing GoT , franchise I ’ otherwise completely tired . Everyone wants move Hogwarts ; lunatic would actually want LIVE Westeros . In escapist genre , ’ interesting . It ’ subliminal royalism ; ’ dark escapism , escape ultimately tends toward reconciliation existing order . And liberals secretly love excuse reconcile existing order ? Westeros makes Prime Day look utopian ! To , good description lot prestige television done , different ways — “ The Sopranos ” “ Mad Men ” “ Breaking Bad ” many . These shows invite liberal viewers various illiberal pre-liberal , I suppose , red-state worlds , violent sexist id-driven polite prestige-TV-viewing liberal society , offer viewers kind escapism Phillips describes … temporary attraction mobster hanging glamorous chain-smoking ’ 50s admen leaving put-upon suburban life behind becoming Heisenberg drug lord . But ultimately worlds clearly wicked , dystopic reactionary white-male-bastions return relief end history , making Phillips ’ “ reconciliation existing order ” sojourning inegalitarian will-to-power world . Some viewers — “ bad fans ” root whackings hate Skyler White — ’ make return like will-to-power stuff much ; programs dangerous . But shows properly understood ’ celebration illiberalism ; ’ exploration attractions ultimately confirms liberal world norms . “ Game Thrones , ” however , somewhat different . Yes , makes current situation Westeros look hellish , effectively condensing horrors century medieval history short years civil war . And yes , ’ much darker bloodier much higher , “ wait , I thought hero ” body count lot fantasy fiction , lets people describe somehow Sopranos-esque . But fundamentally “ The Sopranos ” story without heroes , tragedy moral compass ( uncertain Dr. Melfi ’ arrow sometimes ) supplied outsider main characters ’ world . Whereas “ Game Thrones ” still working within framework essentially romantic genre — critiquing complicating , yes , also giving us set heroes heroines root whose destinies set bloodlines prophecies , likely end save world darkness chaos less Aragorn Shea Ohmsford Rand al ’ Thor . Put another way : On “ The Sopranos , ” right way mafioso . But “ Game Thrones ” right way lord king knight , characters model virtues office , prove chivalry wise lordship need myth . Sometimes unexpected ways — lady knight chivalry men jeer , dwarf rules justly family members look . But sort reversal typical genre , always hobbits stable boys shieldmaidens ready surprise proud prejudiced . And coexists throughout story emphasis importance legitimacy noblesse oblige dynastic continuity , often strikingly uncynical given dark-and-gritty atmosphere . Consider central family , Starks , wise rulers whose sway North endured implausible number generations — “ always Stark Winterfell , ” etc . — whose people seems genuinely love . Their patriarch noble good leaves native fiefdom corruption southern court , naivete still presented preferable cynicism Lannister antagonists , win temporary victories way destroying dynasty amorality singleminded self-interestedness . Then Stark patriarch dead three important sympathetic characters , Jon Snow , Daenerys Targaryen Tyrion Lannister , highborn heirs unfairly unjustly passed deprived birthrights ( Snow “ bastard , ” really ) , outright wickedest human antagonists , Boltons Freys bad King Joffrey , respectively rebellious vassal bastard son , vicious wretch breaks Westerosi society ’ basic moral code , monarch rightful king twice — ’ product usurpation followed incest deception . Meanwhile central secret stories ( pretty easy figure ) two important houses joining bloodlines produced long-prophecied figure , double-dosed monarchical legitimacy like crazy Stuart-Habsburg hybrid . At time , lower-born figures appreciate , lesser lords commoners , ones find greater lord serve ( Davos Stannis , Pod Tyrion , Sam Jon , various figures Daenaerys ) , lower-born nobles commoners seek power right ( Littlefinger , High Sparrow ) generally much morally ambiguous . I could go , course I ’ oversimplifying , get point . My tweets notwithstanding I ’ mindreader subconscious , I ’ prove left-leaning people watching soaking “ Daeny lies water ” “ root , root root Stark restoration ” vibes . ( Though I struck last season way many show ’ good liberal viewers clearly rooting Cersei Lannister , embodiment ruthless aristocrat , rare — , course , self-interested — champion-of-the-common-people High Sparrow … ’ puritan , ostensibly , I suspect also show ’ version bad fandom , glamour monarchy makes root even wicked aristocrats couple sympathetic qualities . ) But modest , less-mindreading point I would stand . As I said , fantasy Tolkien present ( fictional forms role-playing varietals ) partakes nature romantic reactionary themes , often scratching anti-modern itch certain forms far-right New Age lefty politics — perhaps monarchical itch certain forms Macron-esque centrism well . There fantasy writers completely deconstruct tendency , beheadings betrayals Martin — unless serious surprises store last two books — one . Westeros naturally appealing liberal audiences Hogwarts , yes ( I thoughts well ) , still dystopia style Gilead antechamber hell style Tony Soprano ’ gangland ; instead ’ world fabric feudal society gets rent root particular set noble families regain rightful place help weave back together also saving world ice demons according prophecy . As doorway illiberalism different kind doorway offered Soprano crime family : In end , whatever politics world , show ’ bad fans good fans rooting queen king .

But “ The Sopranos ” clear marker beginning era ( even I hate term “ Golden Age ” ) anything TV . Before “ The Sopranos , ” yes , TV dramas could take risks ( “ Twin Peaks ” ) tell stories difficult people ( “ NYPD Blue ” ) . But ducks landed Tony ’ backyard pool January 1999 , immense flock followed . TV series , saw , could rely audiences pay close attention long-running story . They could high visual narrative ambitions . They could resist quick answers ( answers , case Russian “ Pine Barrens ” ) tidy moral conclusions . If “ The Sopranos , ” debuted 20 years ago week , built ground floor , list looks TV erected top . These 20 best drama series emerge since “ The Sopranos , ” arranged chronological order . For sake focus sanity , Mike Hale , Margaret Lyons I limited debates American series TV drama . What American ? ( Shows made specifically United States TV market rather acquired . ) What series ? ( Shows meant continue one season . ) What TV ? ( What ’ , days ? Anything broadcast , cable streaming fair game . ) Oh , yeah : What “ best ” ? It ’ “ influential ” ( sometimes great art inimitable ) “ widely praised ” ( cop-out ) . Here , ’ subjective , rough consensus three humans , different tastes priorities , argument bargaining . It ’ science . The final judgment , hopefully well-informed , inherently right . The trickiest question , though , , What drama ? Episode length ’ absolute guide , awards nominations help . ( “ Orange Is New Black , ” say , Emmy nominated comedy drama . ) I ’ like say came bulletproof formula — length plus tears divided jokes — truth , went feel . “ Transparent , ” lights , clearly drama , awards submissions notwithstanding ; “ 30 Rock ” plainly . The nebulous in-between zone best TV made , ’ later picks come ( like “ Atlanta , ” TV ’ best drama best comedy given week ) . If resulting list stretches definition drama , good : “ The Sopranos ” certainly . ( It funniest show TV weeks . ) You ’ swap shows . ( So would , individually , wrote near-misses . ) But step back , I think list broadly tells story American TV drama become two decades . Looking period historically , geologically , I see three somewhat overlapping sub-eras . Concurrent “ The Sopranos , ” set dramas took TV staples ( cop show , western , sci-fi saga ) , roughed problematized . Next , starting around “ Mad Men ” ( “ Sopranos ” alum Matthew Weiner ) , drama ventured varied subject matter ( greater variety outlets ) . Finally — period ’ still — came Great Diversification , characters ( Tony ’ early followers lot middle-aged white guys agita ) formats , styles , voices tones . What comes next ? We conscious ( maybe little surprised ) one streaming-TV series made list . I ’ theorized like early days TV , comedy easily adaptable new platforms , whereas drama still figuring mesh episodic TV endlessness binge . Very likely next version list ( ’ read 10 20 years corneal implants ) reflect next wave dramas evolved master format , maybe others . “ The Sopranos , ” remember , ended cut black .

In Ricky Gervais ’ new Netflix show , “ After Life , ” plays small-town journalist , widowed , abandons rote politesse rest us rely get comfortably days . As always case Gervais ’ work — ’ probably still best known co-creator star original “ The Office ” — deeply cringe-inducing comedic moments ensue . “ Anything ’ slightest bit interesting , ” Gervais said , “ many people going hate love it. ” Indeed , since “ The Office , ” debuted 2001 , Gervais ’ output — whether television , film stand-up — divisive , times drawing criticism smug mawkish never detriment popularity . “ There ’ objectivity comedy , ” said 57-year-old , frequent Twitter lightning rod . “ You ’ got emotions. ” Has social media changed way public perceives work ? Yes , ’ example : 20 years ago , saw something TV offended wanted let someone know , would ’ get pen paper write , “ Dear BBC , I ’ bothered. ” But ’ much trouble . Now Twitter , go , “ [ Expletive ] ! ” comedian ’ offended . Then journalist see say , “ So-and-so said thing people furious. ” No . The rest us ’ give [ expletive ] ’ heard ’ made headline . Everything exaggerated . But everything ’ also illusion . No one would talk street like Twitter . They ’ never come say , “ Your articles stink. ” They ’ never ’ normal , ’ normal Twitter ’ nuance , irony , conversation . So take seriously ? You ’ . If ignore Twitter , ’ happen . It ’ like going toilet stall arguing graffiti . If ’ go , ’ exist . But go . I . For fun . Or sometimes research . If I ’ warm-up show I ’ five minutes short material , I ’ search Twitter provocative things . You find dark corners . That ’ good thing Twitter : I used meet maniacs , like Agent Clarice Starling meeting Hannibal Lecter . Now I find dregs safety Hampstead mansion . Has Twitter good comedy ? It . I see cross section society thousand times faster I could ’ otherwise . I ’ got 13 million followers . That ’ world , really . I ’ tweet , “ What ’ subject never joke ? ” Some people fall trap say something like , “ Psoriasis. ” Then I come 10 minutes . Sounds like good 10 minutes . What ’ something ’ researched online helpful developing joke way ? There ’ loads things . Onstage I ’ read responses “ These things never joke , ” whatever I say quite funny head think one person angry joke . People think someone joking issue worst thing world . I joke “ Fallon ” peanut allergies , someone said I never talk food allergies . I joke AIDS , famine , cancer , Holocaust ’ telling I ’ joke allergies ? The audience got clever enough know I ’ playing idiot saying wrong thing comic effect . That ’ one things comedy : laughing wrong thing know right thing . What makes confident audience knows ? All give clues . I tweet said something like , “ I ’ typical liberal , lefty , socialist , snowflake . I agree antiracists … yet I talk freedom speech , I ’ suddenly alt-right. ” 1 When happen ? You ’ saying Twitter dirty toilet stall human thought , also rely generate material . Aren ’ interesting places look ? Do mean , I fighting easiest targets ? Why I picking extreme examples ? Because I ’ comedian , politician . My job funny . If I little intelligence fall right side , ’ bonus . To answer question , “ Do I care ’ someone ’ taking irony face value ? ” You ’ legislate stupidity . These fair questions ’ asking unfair ask comedians . The misunderstanding contentious subjects comedian deals people think ’ taking wrong side . I ’ heard posh radio shows discussing whether Ricky Gervais “ dealing ” comedy . Well , ’ talking ! Why ’ I deal comedy ? You might like I say , ’ mean I ’ deal . To mind bigger question ’ whether somebody ’ joke subject , , course , everything fair game . No , course . Everyone says , ’ one thing makes go : “ Too soon ! Wrong forum ! ” When I write joke , ’ like I ’ gone , “ That ’ funny , I ’ care hates it. ” I try make anyone ’ offended , I explain ’ . Gervais Kerry Godliman ‘ ‘ After Life. ’ ’ Rich Hardcastle/Netflix , via Everett Collection What I saying rational person listening good faith probably believes subject table joke . That ’ right , ’ rare . So important question whether jokes aimed worthwhile targets , ’ cheap . I understand point , fair question . The joke I “ Humanity ” special “ When ’ raped Satan , I ’ laughing ” — ’ irresistible ’ mental . If less mental , ’ funny . If someone says , “ I ’ agree atheism ” — O.K . I ’ go anywhere joke . So I pick extreme examples ’ funnier . The material “ Humanity ” provoked — And I knew would special went : Caitlyn Jenner . My question Caitlyn Jenner-specific jokes . You build bit larger thing transgender identification , get part wanting self-identify chimp named Bobo . Is instance material intellectually achieving wanted achieve ? That bit changes halfway . So I come I ’ explaining joke Golden Globes , I stand . It celebrity killing someone car.2 That clearly joke . But I say people thought I feud Caitlyn Jenner , I go : “ It clickbait . Of course , I rose bait. ” So I ’ saying I ’ spoiled childish . Then I get spoiled childish bit goes . I become idiot believes transgender changing chimp . But I joke like I mean work . To connect something said earlier : Was audience laughing right thing ? You ’ think lot people laughing comparison transgender person someone wants identify chimp ? Some people logical get . Some also people saying , “ I might agree , ’ gone far , I ’ glad ’ scared talk it. ” I ’ talking subject new material . I ’ talking cases people ’ trans ’ saying get put women ’ prison rape women . That ’ really thing , ? Oh , yeah , actual thing.3 I say genuine trans people arms . I ’ clear perpetrators I ’ talking ’ trans people . Then I play get things wrong within joke . Why transgender people seem like ripe subject matter ? Is ’ level uncomfortable ? It ’ Twitter . You look Twitter , seems like ’ trans activists versus TERFs,4 ’ going end like battle scene “ Game Thrones. ” Then go real world , ’ happening . You might want spend less time social media . I ’ fine long I properly calibrate ’ online also still remember walk outside sun . That sounds like drug addict saying , “ I ’ fine long I balance uppers downers. ” I could wrong . But , I know I ’ . There idiots Twitter . But idiots High Street . They ’ talk . I imagine ’ possible critics ’ willing give credit way move stand-up telling jokes intended understood dumb telling jokes intended understood smart . Is elision part bothers people ? Well , exactly . I ’ smartass plays religious belief5 whatever go way . Most people ’ got time analyze jokes , I go parody fast . But long I know target people get agree , I think jokes justified . Gervais ‘ ‘ The Office ’ ’ 2002 . BBC/Photofest This realm therapist ’ question , often play characters , whether ’ David Brent “ The Office ” Tony “ After Life ” compulsively commit social faux pas . How much ? Do feel always level self-awareness ’ saying ? I try . I ironic jokes social life . All people joke , ’ explain . Whereas feel need explain jokes strangers .

Before I could , I learn relate . Getting fat old ugly helped . I ’ know ’ heard Simon Amstell . He ’ British comedian . He said something young , handsome people comedy , like , People already looking ; need ? Do need ? I ’ . I enjoy . I ’ enjoy much “ Humanity. ” I think I proud , rather . I approached differently . With “ Humanity , ” I ’ write like I specials . Instead , I walked beer started talking stuff , like I Twitter . It felt brilliant . The audience engaged straightaway . The good thing special audience known 15 years . So I could throw self-referential things get low status anymore . Traditionally British comedy , comedian ’ wallowing mud people . But people know comedians earn , I ’ go talk , “ Well , I ’ welfare. ” So I get low status two ways . I talk money irony : “ When I flew private plane first time , thought I cook. ” And way I talk things audience better . I talk fat old descended testicles . Is idea outsider important ? It ’ really important . But I ’ one people paid see . They know I ’ one got lucky . But I outsider host Golden Globes . That ’ I bite hand feeds . Imagine I went nice George Clooney ? People home would going , “ Who [ expletive ] ? ” How reconcile need outsider fact ’ clearly one anymore ? I still outsider reminding people Establishment hates . They ’ hate much . You make TV shows . You play arenas . I privileged position , I remind audience everyone likes . And ’ sort true . I ’ son immigrant laborer , I wear bad jeans drink [ expletive ] lager . It ’ part illusion . Audiences need side . You ’ go hate audience want hate . There ’ enough people would pay , know ? It ’ still business . I ’ ashamed making money . What ’ best thing ’ bought money ? Tennis court . Are good ? Oh , . But ’ lovely . Is criticism ’ gotten felt helpful ? Or even valid ? I felt bad Tim Allen Golden Globes gag . He Tom Hanks handing award . I said : “ I ’ go next two presenters . The first made $ 3.5 billion box office , Oscar blah blah blah . The second Tim Allen. ” That ’ unfair . But ’ unfair anyone standing next Tom Hanks going get treatment . Also , cares ? It ’ roast joke Tim Allen . But I ’ want Tim Allen think I mean . He ’ great career . As long people go “ That ’ bit harsh ” rather “ Yes , Tim Allen , [ expletive ] useless … ” I ’ hate . It ’ one standing next Tom Hanks , know ? I worry things . Because person end joke . Gervais onstage Golden Globes 2016 . Paul Drinkwater/NBCUniversal , via Getty Images Hollywood awards shows held days real social importance way ’ even years back . What make shift ? I ’ got nothing someone using platform political idea . Despite people think , I ’ judgmental . One minute I go Hollywood taking seriously , I go Trump caring Hollywood . And I walk two sides I keep politics show . Why ? Because ’ relying audience agreeing , ’ rallying . It loses something comedically . Comedy intellectual pursuit , emotional one . That ’ I ’ real racist , sexist , homophobic jokes . I would hope ’ ’ racist , sexist homophobe . Of course . But I lot jokes ’ “ , ” I ’ remember things real life . It ’ like , start joke “ Why Mexicans… ? ” I ’ stop , whatever answer , ’ . Racist jokes ’ work comedically . But jokes race . I ’ surprised ’ think comedy emotional . Laughing . But ’ triggered getting joke . If ’ agree joke ’ premise , ’ going laughing . If Hitler , telling best jokes world , ’ laugh . We ’ going , “ What bad [ expletive ] ’ done ! ” A minute ago said comedy loses something audience agreeing . I think ’ crazy — Oh , go . If believe vast majority people buy ticket Ricky Gervais show ’ agree believe take sensitive subjects . I play cosmopolitan areas ’ smart enough get irony . That comes back question I pick extreme examples . Because ’ easier people get . Particularly ’ something contentious , ’ want start misunderstanding . There rules , ’ talking canceled wokeness , clearer pick someone like John Wayne . Canceled 40 years death woke 48-year-old issue Playboy magazine ! 6 His quotes awful . But ? As example , I joke taking Confederate statues . I said : “ They amendments . ‘ Great general . A bit racist. ’ ” On subject cancel-them culture , think work someone like Louis C.K. ? Or Kevin Hart . Kevin Hart apologized homophobic jokes . If people ’ accept person ’ apology mistake , ’ value person trying improve . And I hate virtue-signaling . I ’ tell ’ bad . Because pathetic people ’ accusation , people saying ’ like accused . They ’ saying , “ Look good I am. ” They ’ saying , “ I hate thing I would never it. ” Why telling us ? Presumably offended . If I wanted get back : “ Well done , Rick ! Keep good work , boy ! ” I might well tweet “ I rapist. ” Please ’ use headline . You said . I ’ cold sweat . But get back question . How know behavior someone like Louis C.K . affect thinking comedy done ? It depends deed , accusation , time , much liked . You make mind . The Louis C.K . thing — allowed gig ? Yeah , . Are people allowed protest ? Yeah , . But ’ change history . When leaked thing came , I listened . People saying : “ God , ’ terrible . He ’ gone alt-right. ” And ’ contentious stuff loved two years ago ! I disagree . The problem new material good . That ’ opinion . They ’ hackier jokes . But point nothing quality material . It ’ Louis C.K . ’ suddenly alt-right . People look ’ changed whole outlook life way writes jokes . Let ask question related “ After Life. ” Yes , best . I ’ already sweating things I ’ said . The show man ’ decided , result grief , dispense social niceties . As famous person successful person , different perspective rest us value — lack value — obligatory social behaviors us might ditch little power ? The reason ’ nice people consequences nice would make life worse . Why I lie every day ? Because I ’ want hurt people ’ feelings . “ Can come christening ? ” “ I ’ . I ’ giving blood orphanage. ” I ’ say : “ Why would I want come christening baby ? It ’ boring. ” Your last show , “ Derek , ” irony bitterness . “ After Life ” elements , also gets sweetness “ Derek. ” Do see shows conversation ? I ’ .

Two bolts infernal crossbow , Tywin Lannister dead throne , albeit humbler one coveted finally secured family , everything started come apart . “ The Children , ” written series creators David Benioff D. B. Weiss , crammed plenty 75 minutes . It usual work wrapping plot lines setting others motion next season , whereas past “ Thrones ” finales dealt primarily fallout previous episodes , one chockablock often shocking set pieces new dimensions . Tywin ’ death probably biggest surprise — us ’ read books , anyway — others . Stannis Baratheon finally got army . Brandon Stark finally got interesting . Arya finally got away Hound , even colder expected . The dragons made appearance , real bummer . But first , back Tywin , last seen stiffening privy . Not great day . Tyrion pulled trigger , Cersei damage earlier , wielding sordid truth relationship Jaime — lineage two Lannister kings , Joffrey Tommen — like loaded crossbow , daring father force marriage Loras Tyrell . “ Your legacy lie , ” purred relish .

Stannis looked quite comfortable Castle Black , must seemed like Palm Springs compared Dragonstone . Melisandre , however , gave Jon Snow stink-eye flames .

Nope , wizard says , God help , I laughed loud . “ But fly. ” Flying sounds pretty good , right ? Flying means perhaps rising cycles conflict destruction keep Westeros rest mired bloody muck . Bran spent plenty time past couple seasons questing without much payoff . Finally , would seem , first glimpse hope ’ seemed represent .

The Mutt-and-Jeff subplots seem sure remain fundamental series , hard top . The Hound manage fire one last bit pragmatic nihilism — “ Safety ?

What make Arya ’ icy refusal end Hound ’ life , especially considering spot list ?

No one Bloody Gate said , “ Lysa Arryn dead … hold , maybe I notify husband niece disfigured brute ” ? It ’ occur Brienne mention Sansa Arya ?

Look , I ’ sure production standpoint , dragons expensive pull . But c ’ mon ! We ’ already dealing 10-episode season cost-saving reasons . Throw us fire-breathing bone . Who ’ survive finale ? Your guess good mine . A day receiving news “ Game Thrones ” shattered previous ratings records , HBO announced ordered two seasons program , fantasy drama . That would take “ Game Thrones ” six seasons work produced George R.R . Martin , novelist created series . Mr. Martin writing Book 6 planned seven-part series , television series slightly behind , current season — fourth — still within story line third novel . HBO previously ordered one season “ Thrones ” time , show ’ popularity soaring . The premiere Sunday night attracted 6.6 million viewers 9 p.m. broadcast , increase 52 percent last season . It also crashed online service HBO Go overwhelming demand hour . Photo Here spoilers , like , immediately . I demand recount . Nothing worthwhile ever comes easy “ Game Thrones , ” I imagine many us shared certain sinking feeling Oberyn Martell , emerged perhaps winning character narrative recent weeks , seemed dispatch Gregor “ The Mountain That Rides ” Clegane surprising efficiency . Sure enough , apparently cutting big man size , Red Viper dwelled little carelessly upon revenge murdered sister , allowing Mountain upend cave skull front everybody . The formerly unflappable Ellaria Sand screamed lover ’ head splooshed , “ Scanners ” style , arena . “ You ’ going fight ? ” asked incredulously minutes earlier , upon spying hulking Mountain . “ I ’ going kill , ” Prince Oberyn replied . Only time usual confidence turned unfounded . Or ? Because hope , really — I mean hope Tyrion Lannister , whose fate hung balance battle — special sauce rag squire wiping master poisoner Oberyn ’ blade moments contest . Said blade made several good slices Mountain clattered uselessly onto stones beside splattered owner . Was enough trick ? What happens competitors trial combat die ? Does count sort hung jury technicality ? Tywin handed death sentence Tyrion Oberyn met bloody end , I ’ perhaps grasping straws , seems hard accept imp options . So , least I see Mountain rise ground power , I demand recount . The match clearly main event — episode ’ title “ The Mountain Viper ” — anyone else surprised ’ take episode ? The series promising fight since season premiere , Oberyn first laid bloodlust . Even setting aside narrative signposts , battle emblemized one central clashes heart “ Game Thrones , ” one drummed repeatedly season particular : honor versus might . In one corner , Oberyn fighting revenge personal justice . In , Mountain , giant mercenary apparently kills prisoners morning workout ’ even know care ’ preparing fight . Here , would seem , significant event story , ’ even get implications Tyrion , one pre-eminent characters show . But combat sort came went — stylishly shot , sure , presented one many courses week ’ feast intrigue . Did work ? The narrative nihilist applauded , honestly . I liked Mountain Viper buildup , show devoted nearly much screen time Tyrion ’ tale Cousin Orson beetles , sort broad parable man ’ tendency crush metaphorical mule kicks death . ( “ How many countless living crawling things smashed dried returned dirt ? ” Tyrion wonders . ) That ’ partly I thoroughly enjoy Peter Dinklage Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Brothers Lannister thing , partly I appreciate show gives equal weight little moments humanity . But I ’ curious others thought . The match culminated episode full judgments , lacking drama battle royale , inaugurated significant evolutions major characters allegiances one another . In Vale , Lord Petyr Baelish found informally trial death Lysa Arryn , last seen plummeting moon door manifest destiny . While Sansa ’ defense Littlefinger ’ terribly surprising , self-assuredness .

Photo The fantasy series “ Game Thrones ” set wide-ranging debate rape , whether popular franchise — includes best-selling novels , hit HBO television adaptation , line comic books — trivializes sexual violence frequent often graphic depictions . George R. R. Martin , whose “ Song Ice Fire ” novels foundation “ Game Thrones ” series , answered email questions The New York Times books contain scenes sexual brutality , responded criticism moments elicited . These responses entirety . Q . Why included incidents rape sexual violence “ Song Ice Fire ” novels ? What larger themes trying bring scenes ? A . An artist obligation tell truth .

Some critics books said even scenes meant illustrate world Westeros often dark depraved place , overreliance moments course novels , certain point longer shocking become titillating .

As novels adapted TV , comic books visual media , think scenes sexual violence described oblique indirect ways becoming explicit shocking ? Is potential problem ? A . The graphic novels television programs hands others , make artistic choices sort approach work best respective mediums . “ And Then There Were None ” — alternate name 1939 Agatha Christie novel “ Ten Little _____ ” — stands among work startlingly racist original title . It ’ mystery without detective , Hercule Poirot Miss Marple make sense things — 10 people trapped island , murdered one one per instructions macabre nursery rhyme .

After dark twists last week ’ episode resulting hue cry unfolded online , “ Game Thrones ” returned Sunday episode titled “ Oathkeeper. ” That turned pretty nose , various subplots revolved around promises kept , challenged utterly despoiled . 'Game Thrones ' The fantasy epic HBO . Most prominent among oathkeepers , luck would , Jaime Lannister ( Nikolaj Coster-Waldau ) , appeared mostly side right fiendish turn sept last week ( minute ) . He finally visited brother , Tyrion ( Peter Dinklage ) , dungeon pledged support , assistance , gave Brienne ( Gwendoline Christie ) new Valyrian steel sword could use find defend Sansa Stark . Cersei ( Lena Headey ) , treated Jaime usual inscrutable scorn week , ordered break vow Catelyn Stark protect daughters instead find kill Sansa , Cersei blames Joffrey ’ murder . What want name sword , Brienne ? “ Oathkeeper , ” says soberly . She promises find Sansa “ Lady Catelyn , you. ” Because believes Jaime ’ best self . The Kingslayer throws Podrick favor Tyrion , wants town safety , clearly shattered Brienne makes sad departure . Ms. Christie oversold heartbreak somewhat , among us ’ done one time another ? With Jaime turning back mensch week , makes rape Cersei beside Joffrey ’ corpse last week much puzzling narrative standpoint . “ Game Thrones ” full people hideous things one another — question purpose serve story . Many commentators took scene sept evidence show distressingly cavalier use sexual violence storytelling tool . ( This week ’ episode ’ help . ) Was scene simply way illustrate twisted push-and-pull twins ’ relationship ? Or end ? Or remind viewers Jaime still rotten , despite recent turn toward light ? Or people complicated ? If , seems pretty cheap , especially considering sex clearly consensual book . But perhaps another purpose , one ’ come play later show . I know narrative mapped books , series creators telling version . It ’ unreasonable think might revisit moment consequences , perhaps even motivated partially viewers ’ confusion last week . ( Though would later season , case — filming done one . ) Online instant reactions weekly recaps reinforce tendencies toward snap judgments , stories multiyear arcs . I ’ get muddled explanations offered involved show , inflamed online outrage . Some commenters criticized last week describing Jaime ’ attack rape , fair . I hedged based context , specific context ; I stress strongly enough I talking dynamics one interaction fictional , incestuous twins nonexistent realm . The relationship Jaime Cersei twisted , toxic union two dark times astonishingly nasty people . It seemed unsurprising coupling , especially demented setting , would violent edge , ambiguities act . That said , rape rape , even occurs within mutually abusive psychodrama . Photo But let ’ get back week . The episode opened Daenerys Targaryen ( Emilia Clarke ) growing slave army , seems get plenty bigger kept word helped Meereen ’ slaves overthrow masters . “ No one give freedom , ” Unsullied commander Grey Worm told Meereen ’ slaves . “ If want , must take it. ” But , bags swords probably come handy . Soon Dany mounting city ’ Great Pyramid Meereen 1 percenters ( 25 percenters , mentioned three-to-one slave-to-master ratio accurate ) managed survive “ Kill Masters ” clarion call nailed posts . The Dany segments , ponderous orations garish costumes , approach “ Clash Titans ” camp . But episode ’ director , great Michelle MacLaren ( “ Breaking Bad ” “ The Walking Dead ” ) , kept things agreeably epic arresting wide-angle treatments scenes ’ seen many times : slaves paying ecstatic tribute liberator . Imagine ’ feel see dragons , … anyone seen dragons ? How one hide immense , flying fire-breathing monsters ? Are hanging somewhere , feeding Essos livestock mother frees slaves ? And wise let valuable things known world sort traipse sky unattended ? Elsewhere , Lord Petyr “ Littlefinger ” Baelish ( Aidan Gillen ) confirmed Sansa ( Sophie Turner ) rest us “ new friends ” — revealed following scene least include Lady Olenna Tyrell ( Diana Rigg ) — ones killed Joffrey , using Sansa ’ necklace transport poison . He also said ’ Vale Arryn revealed engaged Lysa Arryn , Sansa ’ aunt mother Robin , boy , shall say , advanced nursing age . ( It ’ funny , show dark full terrors , things stick . ) You ’ remember Lysa ’ former husband , Jon Arryn , Hand King Robert Baratheon , essentially instigated whole series dying , leading King Robert bring Ned Stark King ’ Landing . She hates Lannisters , blames husband ’ death . ( Remember trial Tyrion Season 1 ? ) Remember also Hound currently taking Arya Stark Vale Arryn . What might increasingly reptilian Littlefinger store Stark girls ? He seems covet Sansa remotely wholesome way could manipulate Arya ’ hostility purposes . Assuming , course , Stark reunion actually happens . Not great track record . Photo Fate seems also bringing together Jon Snow ( Kit Harington ) Brandon Stark ( Isaac Hempstead-Wright ) Craster ’ Keep . Jon leading band knights capture mutineers , unknown Jon , captured Bran cohorts . ( Also unknown Jon : He ’ bringing along Roose Bolton ’ man Locke . ) The renegade knights turned Craster ’ Keep , cesspool best days , Hieronymus Bosch hellscape . The execrable Karl presides like demented Hamlet — ’ forgive mixed metaphor — chomping scenery drinking wine skull poor Lord Commander Mormont . The preferred hobbies include rape rape , including least one depiction ’ probably egregious needs , ’ keeping tabs . But , narrative purpose overall depravity clear . These ultimate oathbreakers — members Night ’ Watch human beings — den inequity ghastly peek world utterly cleared ethics . Last week saw strong figures like Hound take wanted weak use mere fact victims ’ weakness justify actions . The mutineers ’ bother justifying anything rape , kidnap Hodor-bait sport , lamenting Hodor ’ brawn wasted simple fellow . If I size , Rast says derisively , I ’ king world . At Craster ’ Keep see end game might-makes-right . How look ? A FEW THOUGHTS AS WE TRY TO GET THIS OUT OF OUR HEAD • There plenty else keep us occupied , course , “ Game Thrones ” ’ feel like “ Game Thrones ” unless Tyrion actively involved . Which ’ right , sits jail awaiting trial . We ’ reminded without leavening effect Peter Dinklage ’ crackle wit , show might start wear awhile . I also touched Tyrion Sansa defending nothing gain . The evident tenderness relationship , however involuntarily entered , heartwarming . But heartwarming … • Ser Pounce , ’ name presence serves remind us juvenile Tommen , next king , really , poor kid . Apparently Joffrey used threaten skin Ser Pounce alive “ mix innards food I ’ know I eating , ” Tommen tells Margaery ( Natalie Dormer ) . No surprise Joffrey ’ exactly Wally Cleaver Westeros . • Margaery played right , way . Lady Olenna advised use wiles insinuate Tommen mother , Cersei . “ Just needs done , ” said . Margaery , intuiting special nurturer would appeal Tommen vixen , least . She continues quietly formidable . • The opposite heartwarming : plight last Craster son . Watching squall snow hard take , ultimately I relieved . One , I acute case pop-culture zombie fatigue thus little patience inexorable staggering undead . But Sunday learned ’ something like White Walker council ? And sort White Walker Minister Charge Making New White Walkers ? That ’ much interesting another shambling army ghouls . Two , I afraid might eat baby , I ’ think I would ’ able handle . I honestly said sentence loud , first hopefully last time life : “ I ’ glad ’ eat baby. ” • I ’ sure much , , Brienne Podrick road show ’ seeing , seems like would fun one . • Finally , though episode shot long controversy previous week , Sunday ’ episode serendipitously offer Jaime mild punishment behalf critics . First Bronn , nimbly removing Goldfingers sword-practice smack Jaime across jaw hand . Then Tyrion ’ tart response Jaime ’ claim , lord commander Kingsguard , ’ possibly help escape . “ I ’ hate something inappropriate , ” Tyrion said sardonically , worked levels space time fully cover .

Now ’ becoming increasingly hooked sensation , development potential transform vague northward mission after-school special warging addiction . But seems like something else significant happened Sunday night , … Oh , right . Only MURDER OF THE MOST EMINENTLY HATEABLE MAJOR TELEVISION CHARACTER SINCE … Who ? Benjamin Linus ? J.R. Ewing ? What prime-time rage-crush adept inspiring pure , cleansing contempt execrable King Joffrey Baratheon ? Jack Gleeson blessed incredibly punchable sneer , master stroke , actor , base Joffrey ’ despicableness universally recognizable character faults . He ’ lunatic sadist ( see : Snow , Ramsay ) . Joffrey grotesque exaggeration insufferable rich kid high school — privileged beyond imagining still petulant mean , obnoxious insecure , indifferent value anything anyone . We despised guys , even ’ shooting people crossbows sport . 'Game Thrones ' The fantasy epic HBO . But show like “ Game Thrones , ” three-dimensional characters complicated motives , oddly comforting guy like Joffrey around loathe without mitigation . He gift part brain likes angry , ’ gone — undone mouthful poisoned pigeon pie wine . It ’ sad ’ also satisfying watch convulsing wildly , karma finally catching . It ’ Mr. Gleeson ’ credit ’ satisfying I thought would . There plenty warning , course . Signs last week pointed things going badly royal wedding , smart money Joffrey catch worst . There foreshadowing discussed last week — arrival Oberyn Lannister hater , Joffrey expecting “ trouble ” — well show ’ tendency swing fences . Joffrey ’ death offered biggest narrative shake-up . Then , wedding celebration actually begun , Joffrey out-Joffreying , pushing contempt deeper deeper red pelted Sigur Ros coins , cackled boorish dwarf minstrel show extravagantly humiliated beloved Tyrion . “ Game Thrones ” known pulling rug , routinely telegraphs deaths , , amping character ’ loathsomeness produce maximum satisfaction end arrives ( Polliver , Kraznys slaver , Mero misogynist sellsword ) . By time Joffrey started coughing , I wondered taken long , death scene marvel . Mr. Gleeson managed project real human terror , genuinely , somewhat disturbingly , moving see Cersei , Jaime Joffrey finally huddled together family . ( Name another show could break heart little pair incestuous twins savage spawn . ) Tyrion blamed , course — know gets locked — thoughts turned immediately really dunnit . I watched rewatched scene Zapruder film , looking clues , I still ’ know . So let ’ break suspects order likelihood : • Oberyn Martel : The man said premiere town kill Lannisters . At wedding , less strident still barbed , basically telling Tywin Cersei Team Rape Murder . He ’ seem especially murderous day , , said town kill Lannisters , makes obvious choice . But obvious ? • Melisandre : Remember three “ usurper ” effigy leeches Stannis burn last season ( representing Robb Stark , Joffrey Balon Greyjoy ) ? Well Joffrey ’ demise , ’ two , one go . • The House Tyrell : The big question Joffrey ’ death means Margaery ( Natalie Dormer ) . I ’ authority paths succession Seven Kingdoms , assuming Joffrey ’ find way procreate way reception , ’ even Queen Regent status . The next Baratheon line would Stannis , I assume . [ *Update : I overlooked Tommen Baratheon , Joffrey ’ younger brother , presumptive heir . ] Gendry still radar rowing towards King ’ Landing , presumably . But Stannis outs , perhaps Tyrells plan , possibly one based support Flea Bottom masses Margaery cultivating . Margaery , double-Baratheon widow ( counting brief sham marriage Renly ) , married Joffrey power . I ’ put spousicide past could benefit politically . Beyond , Tyrell case mostly circumstantial . Early , Lady Olenna tells Sansa killing man wedding “ horrid ” wonders “ sort monster would thing ? ” Maybe trying throw people scent ? She also mentions paid food , lingering camera shot pie , butchered birds , Joffrey cut sword . There also way Margaery aggressively shoveled said pie Joffrey ’ face , could red herrings . • Petyr Baelish : “ Chaos ladder , ” Littlefinger said Season 3 , things destabilizing murder king . The freshly minted Lord Harrenhal ’ wedding , exactly operator like Littlefinger would handle assassination plot . He ’ either conspired betrayed ( ) people list , ’ overlook revenge factor — feelings Lady Catelyn Stark seemed genuine . Would rule ? Photo • Varys : Another wildcard , based largely general status court schemer . But notice many times camera cut Varys ceremony ? Each time looked dour preoccupied — striking contrast ( admittedly idiotic ) glee around Joffrey ’ high jinks — point like living meme . ( “ Varys amused. ” ) Perhaps offended dwarf show . Or perhaps waiting , darkly , anticipating execution plot hatched , maybe league … • Dontos Hollard : He certainly motive , repeatedly disgraced Joffrey . Did see quickly appeared Sansa ’ side , helping flee ? • Sansa : She reason kill Joffrey anyone . I ’ see , I ’ wrong . Of course ’ possible combination enemy entirely hand Joffrey ’ demise — ’ exactly charmer . Please share theories comments . The one person seem innocent guy took fall . But Tyrion ’ lot season seems sort sacrificial lamb sins father world fostered King ’ Landing . A moral man sticks place devoid ethics , making easier cut . Speaking daddy issues , major plot development week involved dreaded Ramsay ( Iwan Rheon ) , characteristic fashion , kicked things hunting actual human girl sidekick Myranda creature formerly known Theon Greyjoy tow . They shot girl full arrows , Ramsay stopped Myranda finishing dogs could honor . Because , course . It ’ pretty rich Ramsay teaching anyone virtues restraint since creators shown little writing storyline . His season-long degradation torture Theon maybe biggest misstep series made , point I , like victim , physical reaction anytime Ramsay appears . ( Theon/Reek cowers . Mine ’ weary sigh . ) Nevertheless , Ramsay appears season . Roose Bolton , father , pledged reconsider Ramsay ’ steerage-class status within family takes Moat Cailin , claimed war Ironborn ( ruled Balon Greyjoy , Theon ’ father Melisandre ’ third “ usurper , ” remember ) . Ramsay doubt stir things , point , twisted , one-dimensional malevolence firmly entrenched unrelatable I hard time caring one way . Mostly I ’ looking forward day someone serves Ramsay pigeon pie , move .

I surprised Melisandre ’ tenderness princess Shireen , demonstrated kids seem ones get truly messed things world . Yes , poor uncle screamed burned alive , Melisandre explains , women also scream childbirth , agony gives way ecstasy . “ Afterwards ’ ash bone , ” Shireen replies . • Shae Watch , Week 2 : Do think actually made boat ? • No surprise , second Valyrian steel sword wedding gift Joffrey . “ Such great sword name ! ” exclaimed , fun callback Hound ’ dirty joke last week . • Loved seeing Bronn Apollo Creed Jaime ’ Rocky training scene . ( “ Rocky 3″ Apollo , clear . ) The writers keep finding new ways use Bronn , played mercenary savoir faire Jerome Flynn , I always enjoy . • Brienne lo-oves Jaime ! Brienne lo-oves Jaime ! • Finally , Mr. Gleeson , seems like thoughtful lad , says ’ done acting “ Game Thrones , ” blame ? As Joffrey , achieved sort villainous perfection would hard top , live . He ’ going winningly bumble way rom-com anytime soon . But ’ worth noting truly great mad boy-king . Long live King Joff — well , ’ really work . But really , tremendous .

We also maniacally batty Lysa Arryn – lady need mood stabilizers ever one — sent soaring newly betrothed , Petyr “ Littlefinger ” Baelish , way unexpected , least : What new bride , matter villainous , could foretell spending honeymoon plummeting death moon door ? The mockingbird title could easily refer Baelish ( Aidan Gillen ) , man perfected art faking manages convincingly loyal untrustworthy . He tells Sansa ( Sophie Turner ) arranged Joffrey ’ murder lifelong love mother , Catelyn Stark . Then kisses Sansa ( “ Call Petyr , ” whispers inimitable , creepy way ) . Then rescues Sansa murderously jealous aunt toying Lysa ’ emotions , . “ Oh sweet wife , sweet , silly wife , ” says Lysa sobs , seconds giving fatal shove . “ I loved one woman , one entire life . Your sister. ” ( Pushing redheads death seems bit thing TV season . See “ House Cards , ” Season 2 , Frank Underwood versus Zoe Barnes . ) At least things looking Tyrion ( Peter Dinklage ) , though good way episode things appeared quite grim . Still imprisoned , let twice row men thought could count duel Gregor Clegane , a.k.a . Mountain . Tyrion ’ brother Jaime reveals lousy southpaw , Bronn gotten married apparent simpleton plans older heiress sister . Bronn also seems found self-help book two , judging insipid line feeds Tyrion . “ One misstep I ’ dead – I risk ? ” asks . “ I like . I like more. ” Luckily Tyrion , man vengeance happens town . Prince Oberyn ’ hatred Lannisters matched hatred Mountain , killed raped Oberyn ’ sister slaughtering children sack king ’ landing years ago . “ I champion , ” tells Tyrion . Oberyn ’ gearing chance years , I ’ guessing prepping lines head long , . Perhaps ’ go Inigo Montoya Mountain . He already facial hair accent . Can ’ hear ? “ Hello . My name Prince Oberyn .

Jon reacts way reacts everything : looking pained sulky . Arya Hound still killing random men happen upon countryside , though Hound lets tend sliced neck , manage get bonding time . In lieu pushing forward , Daenerys planning send top men back retake Yunkai slay slavers . But Jorah ’ remonstrances , instead decides offer choice – emancipate die . That sending Jorah Daario together delivers clear message : Play nice , boys , ’ forget ’ charge .

But darkly hints plans Stannis ’ Selyse ’ daughter . “ When set sail , daughter must us , ” says , “ The lord needs her. ” Eeps . In keeping regular “ G.O.T. ” recapper , final thoughts : • In case doubt , Joffrey clearly inherited cruelty mother . According Prince Oberyn , Cersei tried literally emasculate infant Tyrion also ardently wished dead . Jaime ’ blame Tyrion inadvertently causing mother ’ death birth , Cersei ? # getoveritcersei • With Lysa ’ death lost one relatively women Westeros ’ appear Botox brow . • Lysa ’ death may save Sansa marrying yet another psychopathic princeling – time cousin Robin .

Cersei seems coming grips effective childlessness — Joffrey ’ dead , Myrcella Dorne , Tommen belongs Westeros ( father ) latest Baratheon boy-king — ’ working salvage new world order . Lena Headey quietly stole show week , possible competition sword named Longclaw ( bit ) . From moment interjected Tommen Margaery ’ flirtations — sublime work week Michelle MacLaren , episode director — convincingly oscillated icy pragmatism maternal heartache events dictated . Royal court melodrama derives pleasures mash-up manners Machiavellian — tasty paradox wickedness expressed politely . It demands actors great deal tight spaces little visible effort ; “ Game Thrones ” perhaps Charles Dance , Tywin , graceful Ms. Headey department , ’ much . Her scene Margaery coronation set confrontation quickly revealed machinations one , unlike brothers , good Lannister else . She came clean Joffrey , “ shocked ” cruelty would , says , “ nightmare ” husband .

Sansa , sweetheart , actually know word “ lucky ” means ? And Lysa ? Quite piece work . Last week , I said hated Lannisters blamed killing husband , Jon . Wrong .

Well Baelish behind , know . He helped instigate War Five Kings . He put together alliance Tyrells Lannisters . He got Margaery King ’ Landing . He urged Catelyn Stark free Jaime . He orchestrated Joffrey ’ assassination , , interestingly put Sunday , arranged “ ascension King Tommen I. ” So Baelish criminal mastermind , playing long game beginning murder Jon Arryn , ? That seems strain bounds credulity . It seems reasonable cast opportunist building chaos-ladder chaos-ladder . But builder appears ! Any theories ultimate goal ? At least , prime suspect poisoning death Seven Kingdoms , going forward , right ? North Wall , mutineers finally met end , knew would , though I admit speedy death Locke threw loop .

The post-show wrap-up “ Talking Dead ” included statement producer Scott M. Gimple : “ In way see Glenn , version Glenn , parts Glenn , either flashback current story , help complete story. ” ( “ Yup , ’ zombie meat , ” would shorter easy say . ) Maybe clumsy storytelling ; maybe deliberate audience manipulation , part show exactly desperate need ratings boost .

Fans — whether denial , hints source books reports set — doubted immediately . “ Dead dead ! ” show ’ makers insisted . “ Sure is… wink wink ! ” fans replied . I make predictions : Jon may dead resurrected warg soul body direwolf . But I think TV fan base suspects even violent shows reaching limits top , beginning see whole bloody business — originally refreshing change stunts TV past — kind stunt .

Tell Us Twitter What Season 4 premiere get right wrong ? Join Discussion @ JEgner » What comes next appears Lannisters , reunited decisively charge , turn ever toxically one another . Tywin ’ decision turn “ absurdly large ” Stark sword , heavy burden power wielded responsibly , two separate Lannister weapons — “ Two Swords ” episode ’ title , presumably — points deeper divisions rending family . To wit : • Jaime made long tortured return King ’ Landing marginalized father , wants shunt family compound ; derided sociopathic son-phew , King Joffrey ( Jack Gleeson ) ; dumped sister . ( Good luck seat-assigner coming royal wedding . ) • Cersei ( Lena Headey ) , sister question , increasingly bitter buzzed , lips curved cruelly nurses bottomless wine glass gripes father wayward brother . Jaime protests murdered people return , unmoved . “ You took long , ” said , seems deeply unfair , I ’ fine . Honestly , I would watch series consisted solely Cersei getting drunk complaining . ( Her caustic monologue siege King ’ Landing Season 2 probably meanest thing I ’ ever laughed . ) • The noble Tyrion ( Peter Dinklage ) , meanwhile , openly mocked within outside walls Red Keep — ’ good gets days . “ My nephew king wants murder ; wife hates father murdered family , ” tells Shae ( Sibel Kekilli ) moment self-pity . He never received due credit saving King ’ Landing Battle Blackwater , , somewhat uncharacteristically , seems miss merely acknowledging reality , much less complaining , ill-advised court monstrous insecure boy-king . Tyrion seems set fall season — HBO teaser video finds imprisoned dungeon . This unfortunate , part seems person realizes ’ terrible idea invite wedding guests want kill whole family . The Lannisters ’ debts may paid power consolidated , happy clan . Tywin patriarch would guffaw notion happiness matters , physically capable mirth — dominance Lannister name . But know absolute power , show keeps reinforcing notion , larger point seems one ultimate inconsequence political striving face true existential threat . Like , say , army undead bearing north .

Meanwhile , back Wall , Jon Snow ( Kit Harington ) called onto carpet — whatever passes carpet icy edge civilization . Photo One ingenious pleasures “ Game Thrones ” convoluted narrative twists , 78 subplots ( rough estimate ) tend unfold along user-friendly genre lines . You high melodrama ( King ’ Landing ) , buddy-cop capers ( Jaime Brienne , Arya Stark Hound ) , humble hero ’ quest ( Bran ) . In Snow , hardened Donnie Brasco stint Wildlings , appears burgeoning Loose Cannon , testily answering soft-jowled superiors whining procedure . Did kill partner sleep enemy ? Sure .

Also due onslaught : citizens Meereen , next stop Daenerys Targaryen ’ liberation tour . Look , ’ probably going find many saints cities Slaver ’ Bay , ghastly mile markers indication , people especially despicable . Now Mother Dragons ( Emilia Clarke ) angry , untamable offspring getting surly massive . ( Not sure cows Essos graze pure H.G.H . , growth spurt . ) Might finally see Michael Bay-level fiery death ? One hope . Photo A new character Khaleesi ’ camp threw somewhat . Actually old character new face : Daario Naharis , flirty commander , played Michiel Huisman instead Ed Skrein . The casting change reported months ago , I still found jarring , part Second Darrin effect discombobulating even best circumstances . But ’ even Mr. Huisman seems playing essentially rogue ’ “ Nashville ” past couple seasons . Even thing steely softhearted blondes appears unchanged . Indeed , despite charms visceral pleasure returning Westeros , Sunday ’ premiere knocked narrative often episodes “ Game Thrones. ” Aside Second Daario situation , also Prince Oberyn ’ clunky exposition Lannister grudge — could handled Tyrion minutes earlier — odd propensity toward broad comedy . There silly cut statue Joffrey vanquishing wolf — hilarious — king employing faux-heroic stance . Olenna Tyrell ’ cheeky dismissal wedding necklace — husband gave one like , says , tossing shoulder ( ha ! ) — came like outtake “ The Golden Girls. ” Dark contextual comedy always welcome element show — see Hound ’ profanely succinct critique sword-namers — tonal disconnect borscht belt stuff stopped cold . But small , subjective things file I-carp-because-I-care . Otherwise episode , written series creators David Benioff D. B. Weiss , good job setting season introducing new characters without wasting time draggier subplots . Presumably Theon still tormented somewhere bug-eyed weirdo Ramsay , mercifully happened off-screen .

Things started promise week lapsing self-parody end , concluding sort overwrought melodrama “ Thrones ” detractor might assume typical series . 'Game Thrones ' The fantasy epic HBO . The truth closer opposite . “ Game Thrones ” makes dragons , magic fantastical elements feel almost relatable including lots subtler moments recognizable human drama realpolitik verisimilitude . World-altering events emerge grand notions justice venal acts self-preservation — lovers hiding shameful affair , say , old woman scuttling granddaughter ’ marriage terrible person . The wars show ’ knights ’ tales ; cost money . The power ability rule repeatedly demonstrated different things . And . For epic sweep story , gallivanting swordsmen , dynastic ambitions War Five Kings , ’ details draw us . Even dragon queen , turns , life sprawling saga built largely petty hassles . For much episode , saw lofty ideals slapping dreary reality . For Daenerys Targaryen ( Emilia Clarke ) , grandiose notions ruling Meereen get bogged numbing reality 200-strong line supplicants toting burnt goats grudges crucified fathers . Stannis Baratheon ( Stephen Dillane ) growled way loan interview Iron Bank , blustering birthrights bastard kings , rejected lousy collateral . In King ’ Landing , Tywin Lannister ( Charles Dance ) responded reports Dany ’ growing strength sneakiness , saber-rattling , shrugged royal insult Hound ’ dirty comments threw money problem . How much take persuade someone try kill Hound ? Ten silver stags ? Make hundred . Next ! Even predictable sham trial , set one season ’ major flashpoints , veered toward boring plea deal , albeit one ’ gone better Tywin . It promised send Tyrion ( Peter Dinklage ) , family embarrassment , Wall Jaime ( Nikolaj Coster-Waldau ) , reluctant scion , back home procreate someone sister . And I doubt viewers thought things would neatly follow trajectory , I ’ guessing many surprised clumsiness climax . I , anyway , engaging pragmatism episode gave way melodramatic histrionics time took Shae give stilted testimony attesting Cersei-endorsed version crime . Tyrion killed Joffrey way Sansa ’ bed , says , stole wretched Grand Maester Pycelle ’ “ Strangler ” poison . She says Tyrion kidnapped real man kept private plaything . She mocks pet names front everybody throws Tyrion ’ old comments whore back face good measure , finally “ imp ” snapped . I ’ guilty killing Joffrey , growls , “ I ’ guilty far monstrous crime : I ’ guilty dwarf ! ” He went rhetorically Gatling-gun entire courtroom , telling Cersei ( Lena Headey ) watching Joffrey die “ gave relief thousand lying whores. ” He shouted wished killed Joffrey , could also everyone else King ’ Landing . Look , building Tyrion , one blame finally losing cool . Still uncredited saving city Battle Blackwater , began season laughingstock things gotten worse . My issue development execution , usually great Mr. Dinklage chewing lines made jerky everyone else reacting like guest stars “ The Californians. ” As clamor crescendoed , score bludgeoned us lugubrious chords , finally Tyrion dropped hammer : “ I know I get justice I let gods decide fate ! I demand trial combat ! ” Duh-duh-DUH ! As probably clear , I found whole thing bit much , huge letdown one season ’ pivotal moments turn bad “ SVU. ” But feel free tell I ’ wrong comments . Aesthetics aside , interesting questions emerged court scene . The first surrounds , exactly , performing combat . The smart money would seem Bronn Jaime , foreshadowed sparring sessions earlier season . ( Indeed , particularly Machiavellian interpretation would Tyrion saw coming beginning arranged exercises train Jaime prepare Bronn . But seems far-fetched somewhat character . ) Still , ’ event offer Jaime chance make final break Cersei Tywin repping Tyrion someone like contemptible Meryn Trant ? Or , Tywin wanted really nasty — would — Oberyn Martell , seems hanging around narrative purpose ? ( He also , remember , revenge pact Tywin Lannister alliance Myrcella Baratheon ’ engagement Oberyn ’ nephew Dorne . ) I , like benightedly book-less viewers , wait next week find answer . Another bit unfinished business : What ’ Shae ? Her getaway always seemed good true , carrot stick compelled turn lion ? Speaking duplicity — obviously ramifications coming duel — Bronn betray Tyrion said put Shae ship ? Or Cersei ’ minions track afterward ? Or neither ? Elsewhere , got first good look Braavos vaunted Iron Bank , Stannis gave I believe show ’ first explicit description young Tommen yet another Lannister incest bastard . ( I ’ think ’ much doubt blond Tommen pure Lannister . ) Stannis told usual tale usurpers birthrights , Mycroft Holmes ( excellently cast Mark Gatiss ) interested barley-to-troop ratios . “ Here books filled numbers ; prefer stories tell , ” said . “ You see numbers seem unlikely add happy ending perspective. ” But wait , Ser Davos Seaworth says . The 67-year-old Tywin Lannister ’ live forever goes , left capably run show King ’ Landing ? If want back winner , surly Baratheon man . “ There ’ one reliable leader left Westeros , ” Davos says . “ He ’ talk paying people back .

While Paabo continued work Neanderthal period , Reich devoted energy obtaining samples last 10,000 years — historical domain archaeologists . Ancient DNA ’ “ big bang , ” one geneticist described , came 2015 publication , Nature , Reich paper called “ Massive Migration From Steppe Was Source Indo-European Languages Europe. ” On basis genetic information culled 69 ancient individuals dug collaborating archaeologists Scandinavia , Western Europe Russia , paper argued Europeans ’ quite thought . About 5,000 years ago , “ relatively sudden ” mass migration nomadic herders east — steppes eastern Ukraine southern Russia — swept almost entirely replaced existing communities hunter-gatherers early farmers Central Northern Europe . These newcomers known exploit many cutting-edge technologies time : domestication horses , wheel , perhaps salient , axes spearheads copper . ( Their corpses sometimes featured cutting-edge wounds . ) The Reich team inferred major source contemporary European ancestry — probably Indo-European languages well — , fact , Europe far east . And discovery , confirmed near-simultaneous publication almost identical results competing ancient-DNA lab Denmark , monumental implications science ’ understanding whole ancient world . Great migration events — like movement Siberian peoples North America spread voyagers Pacific — outliers norm .

Looking Lapita The ancient-DNA revolution seemed unlikely anything say Oceania , heat humidity made preservation DNA implausible . But 2014 , Stuart Bedford got second surprise call , Dublin-based archaeologist named Ron Pinhasi , frequent Reich collaborator procurer samples . Pinhasi discovered inner ear ’ petrous bone , one densest body , often preserved vast quantities genetic material . Could Reich examine skulls Teouma ? In Vanuatu , human remains often associated ancestral spirits thus taboo — understandably , Bedford emphasized , explaining ’ comfortable digging boring “ Granddad. ” But case , ni-Vanuatu expressed reservations : Local oral traditions contained sacred reference Teouma dead , Chief Alben gave blessing . One Bedford ’ colleagues opened skulls workshop warren behind national museum , extracted nubbins petrous bone shipped Dublin , sandblasted . There turned DNA three samples . It first found tropics suggested opening wide new fronts ancient-DNA research . The skulls Teouma particularly interesting paleogenomicists produced first ancient DNA Pacific genetic evidence could brought bear outstanding debate region . The pivotal moment Pacific archaeological history happened 1952 , team researchers found cache dentate-stamped pots place called Lapita New Caledonia , French collectivity southwest Vanuatu .

Whoever made pots 3,000 years ago traveled across 2,000 miles ocean — near Papua New Guinea Tonga Samoa — perhaps little 10 generations . As Patrick V.

In 1965 , Sports Illustrated called “ intrepid ichthyologist explorer , ” trumpeting dozens claims : He could recognize 7,000 kinds fish sight . He landed Trinidad airport , approached pool near runway , onlookers gasped , netted new species . “ He censured professor , ” magazine reported , “ performing Caesarean guppy. ” Guppy surgeon , importance undeniable . In era web forums Google , collectors turned Tropical Fish Hobbyist Axelrod ’ dozens books : “ Koi World , ” “ The Allure Discus , ” “ Tropical Fish Those Who Care. ” His company , TFH Publications , became dominant pet-book publishing conglomerate , catered gecko gerbil fanciers alike invested tetra farms chew toys . He smoked Cuban cigars boasted collecting sea slugs Emperor Hirohito , spearfishing King Leopold III corresponding Winston Churchill goldfish . He also , reportedly , became pen pals prisoners Indiana , , claimed , decades hidden pet fish vials strapped bodies . In later years , Axelrod restyled philanthropist : After sold TFH Publications 1997 $ 70 million $ 10 million loan , became best known collecting Stradivarius violins prestigious stringed instruments , many gave Smithsonian sold New Jersey Symphony Orchestra . ( A 2003 Times Magazine profile Axelrod headlined “ Medici Meadowlands. ” ) But narrative ’ last . In 2004 , indicted federal tax-fraud charges accused hiding money Switzerland ; separately , one many lawsuits attracted , TFH ’ new owners sued misrepresenting finances , Senate committee investigated whether inflated value instruments . He fled Cuba — “ Herbert Axelrod sits oceanfront bungalow Hemingway Marina , fugitive justice , poring photographs hamsters , ” The Star-Ledger reported Havana — later extradited Germany . He sentenced 18 months prison tax fraud . Paradoxically , hobbyist observed MonsterFishKeepers.com , Axelrod , confined like tetra tank , ended “ living life fish. ” “ I remembered someone disrespected law , ” Axelrod lamented 2005 . But death May Switzerland , tributes rang admirers disparate violinist Joshua Bell Australian Society Fish Biology . And name still adheres dozen species , including , course , Paracheirodon axelrodi . For Axelrod , tetra ’ discovery pet . It ’ profound beginning fortune notoriety . It symbol all-too-human foibles obsessions , real imagined , stuff emperors prisoners priests . Maryam Mirzakhani mathematician , worked like artist , always drawing . She liked crouch floor large sheets paper , filling doodles : repeated floral figures bulbous , rubbery bodies , appendages sliced clean away , like denizens lost Miyazaki anime . One Stanford University graduate students said Mirzakhani portrayed problems mathematics daunting logical conundrums animated tableaus . “ It ’ almost like window math landscape , trying describe things living interacted , ” says Jenya Sapir , assistant professor Binghamton University . “ To , ’ happening once. ” Mirzakhani grew Tehran dreams becoming writer . In sixth grade , started Farzanegan , school city ’ gifted girls , earned top marks classes — except math . Near school year ’ end , instructor returned math test marked 16 20 , Mirzakhani ripped stuffed pieces bag . She told friend ’ came math : “ I ’ even going try better. ” Mirzakhani , though , constitutionally incapable trying , soon fell love subject ’ spare poetry . As high school junior , best friend , Roya Beheshti , became first Iranian women qualify International Mathematical Olympiad , next year , 1995 , Mirzakhani took gold medal perfect score . Mirzakhani moved United States fall 1999 , graduate school Harvard . Her passion geometry , particularly drawn “ hyperbolic surfaces , ” shaped like Pringles potato chips . She explored universe extreme abstraction — “ moduli spaces , ” every point represents surface — dimensions exceed . Somehow Mirzakhani able conjure aspects spaces consider , doodling white sheet paper try idea , remember one , search new one ; later would transcribe adventures conventional symbols mathematics . “ You ’ want write details , ” told journalist . “ But process drawing something helps somehow stay connected. ” Her Ph.D. thesis began counting simple loops surfaces led calculation total volume moduli spaces . This allowed young scholar publish three separate papers top mathematical journals , one contained surprising new proof famous “ Witten conjecture , ” milestone theoretical physics connecting mathematics quantum gravity . Mirzakhani ’ mathematics treasured great creative leaps , connections revealed distant fields , sense grandeur . When Jan Vondrak , would become husband , met 2003 , idea , says , “ superstar. ” Mirzakhani finishing Harvard , Vondrak , Stanford mathematics professor , grad school M.I.T . ; met party , recognizing kindred spirit ’ especially enjoy parties . Vondrak introduced jazz , two went long runs along Charles River . Mirzakhani modest — Vondrak learned many accomplishments common friends — bracingly ambitious . Vondrak recalls dreams future discoveries moduli space , also resolve explore distant fields , like number theory , combinatorics “ ergodic theory. ” She , Vondrak said , “ 100 years plans. ” Three years ago , Mirzakhani , 37 , became first woman win Fields Medal , Nobel Prize mathematics . News award , obvious symbolism ( first woman , first Iranian , immigrant Muslim country ) sat uneasily . She puzzled discovered people thought mathematics women — idea friends encountered growing Iran — inclined , personality , tell others think . As became major celebrity among Iranians , people would approach ask photo , hated . The Fields Medal also announced finished grueling treatment breast cancer . In 2016 , cancer returned , spreading Mirzakhani ’ liver bones . Everyone knew Mirzakhani describes unwaveringly optimistic ; always left conversations feeling energized . Eventually , though , became impossible Mirzakhani continue young daughter , Anahita , called “ painting. ” At Stanford memorial service , Curtis McMullen , Mirzakhani ’ thesis adviser chairman Harvard ’ Department Mathematics , said student , would come office pose questions “ like science fiction stories , ” vivid scenes saw unexplored corner mathematical universe — strange structures beguiling patterns , motion interconnected . Then would look blue-gray eyes . “ Is right ? ” would ask , might know answer . For 38 years , Barkley Hendricks began Art 111/112 class asking student bring three small objects meant something . The items varied , dubbed bottle-shoe-and-plate project , objects students chose . Over semester , students would draw redraw — different styles , different media , different orders — satisfied . While student worked , circled room , clutching thermos tea honey lemon , peering papers . He known harangue students not-perfectly-rounded teacups loudly harrumph overdramatically shadowed plates . “ You ’ college , ” would chide disappointed . It class people cried . At Connecticut College , small liberal-arts school enough blond heads Vineyard Vines belts around arboretum looked , certain days , unlike country club , Hendricks considered “ intense. ” ( I know . I . ) He made striking reputation : Students either loved hated . Either way , warned one another : “ Knows ’ kinda mean , ” read one review RateMyProfessors.com , virtual bible student-generated reviews popular campus . Another wrote , “ Consider taking courses 2nd semester hates winter , ’ sympathetic grades close spring ! ” Hendricks really hate winter . On holiday break , often traveled Jamaica wife , Susan , painted landscapes . He began painting professionally mid-1960s ; frustrated lack black representation Western canon , created life-size portraits mostly black subjects : family members , people met street , . The audacity subjects , often faced forward braggadocious stances , wearing monochromatic clothing , combined charged politics era , made critics label Hendricks capital-B Black painter political aims , vehemently rejected . In famous work , “ Brilliantly Endowed ( Self-Portrait ) , ” stands nearly naked pair bright white tube socks brimmed hat , thumb forefinger framing penis . It ’ major political statement : He ’ heard self good subject “ since , ” said , “ always around. ” One first portraits , “ Lawdy Mama , ” light-skinned woman luxuriant Afro , rumored militant activist , maybe , inevitably , Angela Davis Kathleen Cleaver , Hendricks ’ cousin . He maintained painted solely liked , without hidden messages . His landscapes , loved , never received attention portraits . In March 2016 , Hendricks turned final solo show Jack Shainman Gallery New York . The news release called exhibit “ political date. ” The show included monochromatic portraits known — like “ Manhattan Memo , ” shadowy depiction man expletive-laden black T-shirt paint-smeared jeans , “ Photo Bloke , ” man outfitted soft pink suit — art-world coverage show focused paintings seemed strike new tone . “ In Crosshairs States ” features young black man arms raised , gray hoodie flipped around face . On front garment , messianic figure , also black , looks ; Confederate flag fabric American flag engirdle portrait . In interviews exhibition , Hendricks rebuffed assumptions adopted new radical bent . “ Anything black person terms figure put ‘ political ’ category , ” chided one reporter . “ I ’ I want . I paint I like paint . I paint I ’ motivated variety reasons I ’ think always necessary blab about. ” He painting , insisted end , saw . Shirley Childress Johnson became professional sign-language interpreter time number black sign-language interpreters vanishingly small . The work personal : Johnson ’ parents deaf ; learned English American Sign Language simultaneously . She profoundly aware joys deaf culture , demands full face-to-face engagement , well urgency making basic information accessible community . She attended births , trials presidential inaugurations . She interpreted Maya Angelou pro bono people met street . She wrote took people ’ pain deeply translated struggled “ ventilate feelings. ” She viewed emotional sensitivity liability work , one day turned asset . In 1980 , invited work Sweet Honey Rock , internationally acclaimed African-American women ’ cappella ensemble , perform lush , intricate arrangements protest songs , wordless chants , spirituals poems . The group started 1973 Bernice Johnson Reagon , preacher ’ daughter founding member S.N.C.C . Freedom Singers , traveled around country sharing news civil rights movement . The church Reagon grew Albany , Ga. , piano , learned earliest lessons music power lies singing unaccompanied ; eliminating instruments paring sound voice allowed unfurl full range join others completely . In late 1970s , Sweet Honey ’ tours booked politically minded coalition women called Roadwork , offered wheelchair accessibility , child care sign-language interpreters concerts . But network ’ interpreters , white , bad fit Sweet Honey . The Sweet Honey singer Ysaye Barnwell recalls one interpreter sound check signed “ Africa ” rotating finger around nose indicate nose ring . The group decided look interpreter ; found Johnson , chemistry immediately apparent . Johnson grew attending silent ministry Shiloh Baptist Church , singing spirituals flowing sign . “ We ’ record player home , singing sign church probably first exposure song , ” Khaula Murtadha , Johnson ’ sister , says . She intuitively understood translate Sweet Honey ’ music . “ She amazing way using body hands help people understand rhythm music , ” Barnwell says . Interpreters usually stand side stage separate area . Johnson sat semicircle ensemble , moving time . In concert footage appeared 1983 documentary “ Got ta Make This Journey : Sweet Honey Rock , ” Reagon strolls across stage ebulliently bellowing “ Down Riverside ” casually goes riff Johnson , Bruce Springsteen might Clarence Clemons . As Reagon approaches , Johnson turns partly away audience face ; Reagon lunges , Johnson lowers match . Johnson ’ role full member Sweet Honey still unmatched . As Barnwell would lay bass line seemed drawn deepest well Reagon ’ voice would go incandescent praise , Johnson would remove sound song , conveying words feeling ran . Dennis Banks , whose Ojibwa ( Chippewa ) ancestors ’ names registered ship ’ manifest , looking put roots . Born reservation Minnesota , Banks shipped Bureau Indian Affairs boarding school age 5 , better erase heritage . When returned home 11 years , mother moved started new family . In 1968 , stint Air Force Japan ended Banks going AWOL , two half years jail burglary rap , helped found American Indian Movement ( AIM ) advance interests Native Americans . Having renounced alcohol , Banks made way Pine Ridge reservation South Dakota . He asked medicine man indoctrinate Lakota rituals . Banks desperate connect tribal past ; ’ quibble tribe ’ . He began regularly practicing rituals smudging , singing drum , pipe carrying religious use tobacco . He insisted spiritual component AIM well . He promoted sweat lodges sun dances , flesh pierced suffering endured , means transforming alienated youth warrior priests . The rituals inspired community , Banks . He charismatic leader , adept building social networks . Later life , coached runners organized spiritual marathon runs around world . He also produced community , marrying four times fathering 20 children . AIM ’ spiritual communion past underscored conundrums present — fully Indian fully modern , American Americanness thing , along land beneath feet , stolen . Amid revolutionary fashion early 1970s , AIM ’ look cool — buckskin , braids , feathers , rifles . But Black Panthers preached revolution , AIM called restoration . Its demands rock-ribbed Republican . It wanted property rights safeguarded , borders enforced , laws respected , debts paid , treaties upheld . Banks instrumental attracting recruits AIM connecting myth , history one another . But realistic vision future never jelled . And political system honored wealth valued votes , Indians , reduced less 1 percent population , largely impoverished , possessed neither . In lieu power , Banks opted attention , operating guerrilla theater used live ammunition . “ I think helped Native Americans realize still count need step forward let U.S. society know still , ” says John Echohawk , founder Native American Rights Fund . Banks photogenic colleague Russell Means became The Los Angeles Times called “ famous Indians since Sitting Bull Crazy Horse. ” There collective pride , along jealousies , rivalries subterfuge . When trusted aid Banks announced F.B.I . informant , government ’ counterintelligence work done : Fear infiltrators led suspicion vengeance . In historical inversion , AIM would go occupy white property , recouping symbolic fraction bill cosmically arrears . But endgame , given lopsided power AIM ’ federal adversaries , always distant , staging improvisational . When Banks led caravan AIM members Washington 1972 , group sat Bureau Indian Affairs headquarters ( cafeteria ) refused leave , small part night coming failed secure accommodations . AIM ’ last stand Wounded Knee , S.D. , similarly ad hoc , strategic fiasco slathered media . Hundreds Lakota massacred site United States Army 1890 . Seeking dramatize local corruption pervasive injustice also honor dead , AIM moved tiny hamlet Pine Ridge reservation minimal planning . Provisions ammunition soon ran short . Hundreds government agents laid siege ; AIM held 71 days . Two AIM supporters killed ; another ’ body never found . ( A suspected F.B.I . mole , may murdered . ) A federal marshal paralyzed . AIM surrendered , unraveled . Banks took life run , making underground tour 1970s bizarro , star turns William Randolph Hearst ( sought Banks ’ help finding kidnapped daughter ) , Marlon Brando ( supplied Banks mobile home $ 10,000 getaway ) cult leader Jim Jones ( raised bail Banks ’ wife leading followers mass suicide Guyana 1978 ) . Banks eventually served short stint prison charges unrelated Wounded Knee . He kept faith spiritual renewal encouraged children draw spiritual strength rituals running . But paradoxes persisted . His preferred nomenclature “ human rights activist , ” 2004 autobiography titled “ Ojibwa Warrior. ” He lavishly extolled healing powers native medicine , died Mayo Clinic . As AIM prepared surrender Wounded Knee Banks readied escape federal cordon , Lakota medicine man said prayer make Banks invisible . That 20th century Indian , defiant survivor , require ministration achievement . He 37 , Hollywood B-lister almost decade . Every landed choice small part — movie Paul Newman — career mostly succession failed TV pilots ( eventually 13 ) roles , would later write , “ shot , beat put trial. ” Just looked big break would never come , offered part might finally make household name , help forget billed chimp . But catch — character comic-book figure already adored , least known , legions . There would expectations . And even got right , risked typecast rest career , like every actor ever played superhero . This dilemma facing Adam West , former William West Anderson , contemplated becoming TV ’ Batman fall 1965 . He certainly looked sounded part : He tall , handsome , fit , voice Bond-like mix suave smarm . He read comics boy growing ranch Pacific Northwest . But Batman different — tortured , noirish character came life 1939 , shadow totalitarianism , rather one ready colorful , splashy 1960s , brooding cello replaced snappy Motown bass . Batman heartthrobby teenage sidekick , Robin , would still saving Gotham City archcriminals weekly basis . But ’ wink nudge , hurling pies often punches . Five minutes reading initial script , West giggling . He knew would stretch . But nothing else , figured , could fun part . He took . And immediate sensation . “ Batman , ” broadcast consecutive nights , famous cliffhanger end Part 1 , “ batapulted ” Top 10 shook annals sitcom-dom , time still ruled slapstick antics Lucille Ball hokum “ The Andy Griffith Show. ” Yes , Robin ( Burt Ward ) dreamy , faux-Space Age sets great fun , showbiz royalty bellied ( hammed ) play criminals ( three first five Special Guest Villains alone former future Oscar winners nominees ) . But West ’ performance stolidly absurd caped crime-fighter weirdly gave show ballast . Whether correcting Robin ’ grammar jumped fray ( “ It ’ ‘ easily , ’ Robin ” ) advising Robin “ acquire taste opera , one poetry olives , ” warning could killed “ worse , ” punctuating every word leaving pauses could drive Batmobile , reading Ionesco . When Black Widow ( Special Guest Villainess : Tallulah Bankhead ) told Batman “ crashing bore , ” ’ , sense , offering higher praise . He kind silly . He kind dork . Even body kind ... real . The one time got peek costume , spa-set episode ( Special Guest Villainess : Zsa Zsa Gabor ) , Batman ’ alter ego , Bruce Wayne , briefly bare-chested , saw overbuffed Jack LaLanne type rather lithe swimmer ’ build , probably came handy earlier surf-off Joker ( Special Guest Villain : Cesar Romero ) , though ultimately Batman saved day handy shark repellent . The show flamed three seasons — spring 1968 , real-world crises like Vietnam assassinations campus unrest raging , Caped Crusaders ’ utility belts ( , show ’ scripts ) coming empty . West soon consigned back pilot graveyard , feared , never quite able shed cape cowl . He might reached low , years later , shot cannon Batsuit . But Batman lived reruns , men later played part , like Michael Keaton voice actor Kevin Conroy , credited giving character dimension , West ’ honorable goofball made lasting impression , least young boys grew gay men . There much speculation whether Batman Robin gay , , since series . But beyond high camp , dress-up whatever may may happened darkened corners Batcave , true gay vibe came bromance among Batman , Robin , Alfred butler Police Commissioner Gordon ( practically every episode TV series reached Batphone proclaimed variation “ There ’ one man ... ” ) . These men whose daily business loving protecting city also one another , even sometimes put mask . ( And course rad revolving wall Barbara Gordon/Batgirl ’ apartment , big gay flash point , ’ another story . ) West lived long enough see albatross role turn medal honor ; even lent voice subsequent Batman animated series . And grew philosophical character defined career . “ It ’ like ‘ Hamlet , ’ ” wrote “ Back Batcave. ” “ When ’ teenager , read play ’ ‘ Hey , I get ! Hamlet ’ problems home drive crazy. ’ Twenty years later , ’ sure. ” But one key enduring appeal Batman , matter playing , , West wrote , superhero without superpowers , maybe push-ups homework , , , could accomplish great things . ( It ’ hurt rich . ) What West ultimately conveyed portrayal , though , something slightly different : His Batman showed us occasionally need superheroes little like us . It ’ wonder finally got next major role , age 71 , animated “ Family Guy ” series , ludicrous , deranged nevertheless lovable mayor named ... Adam West . Pow ! Zap !

One question animated life : What happened turn person capable ? She understood dug deeply enough person ’ history , two three generations necessary , would find original wound , understood wound traced downstream effects , would care enough preserve person ’ life . Holdman lawyer — studied anthropology . She hurled civil rights protests ’ 60s saw death penalty , especially racist , classist way meted United States , ultimate human rights fight . Holdman argue clients ’ innocence . ( Capital cases two phases : one determine guilt , dispense punishment . She primarily involved second . ) But would anything keep clients lethal-injection gurney electric chair . Visit inmates dozens times prove matter horrible things person said , Holdman would keep coming back ; absorb defendant ’ family ’ anger trusted secrets ; track childhood neighbors property records ask recalled abuse . She also trafficked absurd .

She moved introduce tick-tack-toe-playing chicken court — gambit counter one prosecutor argued defendant ’ ability game proved smart enough understand crime punishment , therefore , executed . ( The court refused allow chicken , theory bird would demean court . Holdman suggested killing mentally impaired man would demean court . ) She grew Jim Crow Memphis ’ 50s .

As characters prime-time shows wrestled racism sexism , Cunninghams , part , still oblivious revolutions come , comforts unchallenged .

Preadolescent show ’ early seasons hardly boy crazy , Joanie spoke unimpressed females world . ( Her first line show , brother Richie : “ He ’ got stinky stuff hair ! ” ) As got older , protection Joanie — boys wanted , boys want — became recurring theme . Those story lines surely poignant cast mates ; worried Moran , fact , need protection , though could provide simulacrum . They sensed parents troubled , trouble . In years “ Happy Days ” went air , Moran spoke openly interviews father ’ drinking problem mother ’ resentment success . And much , Moran suggested , cast know , like time father , drunk ABC party drive home , insisted daughter , 13 , take wheel . “ He turns says , ‘ Erin , going drive home , ’ ” Moran recounted talk-show host Maury Povich 1992 . “ I ’ going Beverly Glen , ’ windy mountain road .

Life star dream Moran ; knew , show ended 1984 fame morphed something kitschier less exalted .

And end , died quietly , husband , Steve Fleischmann reported , finding peaceful last moments bed , glow television providing flickering comforts . One cold mountain night 1971 , Royal Shannon Robbins dangled ropes hundreds feet gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan , clutching hammer chisel worrying made shameful mistake . The influential American rock climber 20th century , serious-minded fellow disdained vanity , Robbins spent whole day chopping steel bolts El Capitan , obliterating climbing route called Wall Early Morning Light , created alcoholic rival , Warren Harding . Robbins saw climbing spiritually exalted — “ game play acquiring courage necessary beautiful life , ” put . The sport , view , always quest self-understanding , self-aggrandizement . Climbers made first ascents consider artists creating aesthetic pathways others follow . The canvas great rock walls finite — much cliff — claimed piece responsibility climb along natural rock features minimize use permanent safety hardware , like bolts . To ignore responsibility sin larger climbing community . Harding found pompous ridiculous . A California road surveyor loved fast cars , saw climbing enjoyable silly vice felt responsibility anybody . To establish Wall Early Morning Light , 3,000-foot sweep golden granite , Harding partner lived hammocks 27 days drank cheap wine pandering TV news crews filming . Worst , Robbins ’ view , Harding ascended huge blank sections rock drilling 300 bolts clipping stirrups eliminate difficulty risk . Robbins craved order , greatness confidence right thing . Born West Virginia 1935 , suffered early abandonment father , also named Royal ( “ Ah , Dad , leave ? ” wrote autobiography titled “ To Be Brave ” ) . Then came years abuse alcoholic stepfather named James Chandler , moved family California changed Robbins ’ name . Robbins 10 heard mother beg stepfather put knife . Robbins ran help , Chandler disappeared Robbins soon reclaimed birth name resolved become better man either fathers . He found schoolwork difficult climbing easy . He first climbed Yosemite 1952 dawn sport ’ true golden age , equipment techniques finally mature enough biggest walls , Yosemite ’ marquee cliffs remained unclimbed . The obvious first plum 2,500-foot northwest face Half Dome , Robbins heard Harding planning attempt , Robbins scrambled team , 1957 , got top first . Harding retaliated claiming first ascent El Capitan . In 45 days ’ work spread 18 months , Harding created so-called Nose Route keeping ropes always fixed high point ground , commuting food wine , drilling countless bolts basking national publicity . Robbins disturbed 1960 made second ascent Nose Route seven days . A year later , Robbins demonstrated retrograde Harding ’ methods first ascent different route El Capitan 12 days bolts . The resulting route , called Salathé Wall , still perhaps greatest long rock climb Earth . Robbins Harding kept amiable competition — prestigious first ascents soul sport — throughout 1960s . Each time Harding anyone else established big new route , Robbins repeated better style : faster , sometimes alone , occasionally chopping bolts deemed unnecessary . When climbing , Robbins played tennis , read Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote essays calling least one climbs “ better even Mozart. ” Harding ’ one thought Robbins ought lighten , many leading climbers shared Robbins ’ belief first ascents done adventurous way possible , minimal damage wall . So Harding spent nearly month drilling way Wall Early Morning Light 1970 , constant network-news coverage , Robbins firm social footing declaring route “ contrived artificial. ” A year later , partner named Don Lauria , Robbins started Harding ’ opus hammer chisel , beginning operation without precedent history sport — deliberate , violent erasure major new climb created internationally famous climber . Early first day , however , Robbins encountered unbolted section surprising technical delicacy . More bolts followed , Robbins chopped , found still dangerous challenging stretches , became apparent Harding taken greater risks done route adventurous style Robbins imagined . That night , Robbins hung bivouac hammock convulsed self-doubt . He convinced moral authority obliterate Wall Early Morning Light , voice inside told Robbins envy blinding better judgment . The next morning , Robbins put away hammer chisel , without harm , followed Harding ’ route summit . Saturday 4 . Breakfast Bravery , 9 A.M.

Enrico Quarantelli always looking ; compulsion notice everything , passively accept nothing , defined sociologist human . “ I born Nov. 10 , 1924 , New York City , ” says start oral-history interview , adds , “ For reason , I remember absolutely nothing first five years life , ” seems genuinely aggrieved lapse observational record . The animating moment early career came 1952 , suite deadly tornadoes tore Arkansas . Quarantelli part team University Chicago sent study aftermath . The conventional wisdom held survivors would petrified helpless also , somehow , marauding clobbering one another food . ( “ The premise people sheep , except wolves , ” Rebecca Solnit put book myths disaster response . ) But conducting almost 350 interviews Arkansas , Quarantelli colleagues discovered virtually everyone acted rationally , even generously . They protected one another . They rushed look survivors . There traffic jam frantically flee disaster area ; traffic coming , help , worse . Quarantelli looked around realized , recalled , “ This different world assumed. ” In 1963 , two colleagues , Russell Dynes Eugene Haas , established Disaster Research Center Ohio State University . ( The center later moved University Delaware . ) Their idea simple : rush wherever disaster struck , often within hours , document . The center initially funded Department Defense , saw natural disasters proxies nuclear war , full-scale laboratories might learn control pandemonium assumed would follow Soviet strike . But imagining behavior human beings turned quite different actually looking . “ In general , ” Quarantelli Dynes wrote 1975 , summarizing findings , “ cooperation rather conflict encouraged. ” Hysteria largely mythical ; actions mistaken panic , like running , en masse , fast collapsing building , actually reasonable responses danger . “ Natural disasters democratize social life ” “ strengthen community identification , ” wrote . Class distinctions disappear , least temporarily , people suffer work together . Looting exceedingly rare , fears looting rampant . Government bureaucracies , designed rigid dependable , improvise adapt , often left rudderless . But ad hoc groups ordinary citizens arise pick slack . The center ’ sociologists observed “ emergent organizations ” forming disasters around world : teaming switching , like kind civic immune response . Victims disasters often wind heightened feelings kinship purpose . A mentor Quarantelli ’ , Charles Fritz , posited “ social animals , people perhaps come closer fulfilling basic human needs aftermath disaster time. ” Quarantelli ’ inclined philosophical extrapolations , spent career gathering data suggest true . He visited dozens disasters , around United States abroad , dispatched 200 graduate students elsewhere , building literature new field , disaster studies , simultaneously peopling acolytes .

And yet , amid devastation , confusion , suffering mismanagement , people still responded ways always . There Houston mattress magnate opened showrooms displaced Hurricane Harvey ; bands civilian topos , “ moles , ” dug rubble Mexico City ; small instances cooperation selflessness went unrecorded . Still , tended see acts exceptional , evidence makes particular community special , rather consistent half-century rigorous social science . Why struggle see outside myths Quarantelli debunked ? He wondered . It ’ hard accept goodness might ordinary , hard imagine truth deflating reassuring . Certain American artists , long careers , get locked given persona becomes hard , deaths , recall excited people . Like Bob Hope , Glen Campbell victim kind hardening affect . Even public diagnosis Alzheimer ’ trailing , genial , middle-of-the-road version “ Glen Campbell ” became durable commodity I work remind felt like first encounter .

And singer interpreting seemed risen directly forlorn places sang : Wichita , Galveston , Phoenix . Glen Campbell came across strangely pure . But purity , arrives apple-cheeked , all-American form , often bends , unless fiercely protected , commercial pressure become something else . In 1969 , Campbell began hosting TV series , “ The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour. ” Though nothing “ good time ” Campbell introduced ( early songs , “ Gentle My Mind ” onward , dealt one form sorrow another ) though Campbell worked , network objections , find guest spots underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings Merle Haggard , seemed get caught become huge wave .

The “ paradox heap ” seems first like trick , brainteaser must clever catch . But reveals , defies easy understanding , philosophical problem . You might approach puzzle , end devising solution deep would challenge thinking language , knowledge nature reality . By time death brain cancer July 48 , Delia Graff Fara , philosopher Princeton , done . Start heap sand . If remove single grain , remains heap . Repeat process enough times , however , heap sand contains , say , one grain . This absurd : One grain heap . Something gone wrong , obvious . Either precise number grains point heap becomes nonheap , thing heap , classical logic flawed ( perhaps ever sort true something heap ) . Which bullet bite ? This paradox , originated ancient Greeks , troubling ubiquitous . It applies heap also tall , red , bald , soft — gradient-like property . When Fara began working paradox graduate student Massachusetts Institute Technology 1990s , philosophers come view instance larger problem : vagueness . We want take seriously talk hot cold weather , bald full-haired men , day night , boundaries distinguish things seem blurry point incoherence . Fara unsatisfied solutions offer . Some philosophers argued vagueness form ignorance : precise number grains separating heap nonheap , ’ know . Others argued vagueness result semantic indecision : lots possible things could mean “ heap , ” would establish precise number grains heap-hood , ’ taken trouble specify meaning . Still others , looking avoid sharp distinction heaps nonheaps , sought develop nonclassical “ fuzzy ” logics , experimented degrees truth . These solutions advanced argumentative ingenuity technical sophistication , often ways minimized oddities . But Fara , skilled practitioner logic formal semantics , looking solution addressed common-sense question : If precise point heap becomes nonheap — unless want abandon natural language classical logic , seems must — inclined think otherwise ? Fara ’ theory , presented 2000 paper called “ Shifting Sands , ” answer . She argued vagueness expression ever-changing purposes : precise point heap becomes nonheap , “ shifts around ” objectives . In fact , act considering two comparable heaps accentuates similarity , “ boundary never looking. ” No wonder think ’ exist . Imagine gym teacher hastily divided large class students two groups according height . If enter gym , trouble declaring one group tall students short ones . But presented undivided class asked say tallness boundary , would despaired answer . Tallness matter height , Fara concluded . As properties , gets tall also shaped interests given moment . “ Shifting Sands ” became influential highly cited paper , least implications areas philosophy . It also notable written young woman field skews heavily toward men , demographically terms works cited . Concerned imbalances , Fara devoted considerable effort helping women profession . When came racial diversity , area philosophy similarly lopsided , Fara also champion , circumspect .

In several instances accuses members philosophy department , administration board campaigns harassment , vandalism , ultimately , trying kill .

Yet I spoke Selwyn R. Cudjoe , professor Africana Studies instrumental recruiting Piper school , offered another layer complexity . “ Adrian brilliant woman , ” said . “ A brilliant , black woman . Folks philosophy may , resentful , accept excellence among black people easily. ” Cudjoe longest-serving black faculty member Wellesley . He assured , 32 years , found Wellesley “ nurturing place. ” But something conversation whatever happened Piper must touched . Several days spoke phone , emailed : “ Since talking , I thinking . I believe part Wellesley ’ problem — Adrian may victim — quite know treat older black intellectuals , particularly smart Adrian . It might short time ’ quite know whether appreciate talent gifts demonstrate enough thanks gratefulness hired us prestigious institution. ” Whatever one prepared accept plausible , seems undeniable Piper derives particularities experiences elite institutions like Harvard Wellesley certain larger questions real challenges black woman simply black woman , worth taking seriously indeed . Still , allegations Wellesley nagged .

But presumptive Republican candidate faces obstacles four regions likely decide presidency — Florida , upper Southeast , Rust Belt interior West — campaign going growing pains . Derek Walcott ’ poetry pulsated every element literature ever alchemized : nature , human interior , hardship , joy , tragedy , comedy , life world divinity epic . And largely set among everyday people place often viewed backwater history — derelict Caribbean outpost England ’ fallen empire , fit nothing future tourist resort . In 1930 , Walcott twin brother , Roderick , born , island St. Lucia British colony scant population around 57,000 . The twins raised , along elder sister , mother , Alix , schoolteacher .

One former graduate student , Nicole Mary Milligan , sued Walcott Boston University sexual harassment 1996 , eventually settling court . “ I think work stands ages , ’ born deep humanity , ” says , voice navigating suite complex emotions . “ If work remembered , ’ : He great poet. ” He also , says , “ perhaps human God intended. ” Most artists , however great , remain height powers brief arc life , making even remarkable Walcott produced best work final volume . “ White Egrets ” book loss regret , majestic settling accounts , monument lifetime writing friendship .

Columbia Records encouraged cultivate glamorous image , like Carly Simon Linda Ronstadt , instead album cover showed sisters lounging musty couch , braless bashful casual tank tops . The songs , nearly Maggie ’ , world-weary philosophical without ever quite revealing anything . Her persona instead came sideways yearnings like “ Malachy ’ ” : “ Sometimes I used write songs you/As could feel bottom heart. ” Even early 20s , alive moments connection intimacy proved elusive . She Terre ended duo frustration . Soon Suzzy joined Manhattan , , need money , sang Christmas carols around city December 1977 .

Few others made discontent sound harmonious . DeMarlon Thomas native son Saginaw , struggling Michigan city hit hard General Motors plants closed . As came age , employment tumbled crime soared , Saginaw became sort place way easy fall trouble . As kid , Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw ’ perils , busy playing football middle school high school . His mother , Ceaya LaFrance Thomas , gave birth high school , raised grandmother Willie Jane Thomas Ceaya finished . Though Ceaya returned Saginaw college Thomas ’ life , home Grandma ’ . His mother recalls bond two : “ After football practice , ’ go home , take shower get bed mama , ’ curl talk day . He ’ make laugh . He made everybody laugh. ” If Ceaya wanted spend time son , Willie Jane would say , “ Well , spend night us ” — often . After graduating Saginaw High , Thomas headed Division III community college Minnesota play football . He lasted year , asked mom come get , saying school ’ thing . By , Saginaw ’ violent-crime rate among highest nation . His mother , substitute teacher , begged child stay college — degree , opportunities , chance move beyond Saginaw — told missed grandma much . “ I cried way ride get , way home , ” mother remembers .

Its members kids Thomas grew — kids long looked one another city land-mined violence overwhelmed despair . The police , though , blamed Sunny Side escalating drug dealing , shootouts drive-by killings , impelled gang rivalries . Without football keep occupied , Thomas joined one industry thriving : drugs . A year later , convicted selling 0.008 ounce crack cocaine put probation . The court extended probation , months later , negotiated $ 20 sale crack . By , F.B.I. , A.T.F. , state troopers local police midst three-year investigation Sunny Side gang . In 2007 , indicted 17 members , including Thomas , federal charges . Thomas pleaded guilty distributing quarter-ounce crack . At time , mandatory minimums “ war drugs ” leading courts impose long sentences “ career offenders , ” biggest felons , keep streets long possible . The judge concluded Thomas , two state convictions dealing drugs , “ career offender. ” His defense attorney , Amy Grace Gierhart , argued ’ treated like one , telling judge , “ There nothing indicate Mr. Thomas anything small-time , street-level seller. ” She noted federal Sentencing Commission concluded applying “ career offender ” low-level dealers disproportionate impact black defendants , ones visible often sell open poor , minority neighborhoods . The judge persuaded . When Gierhart told Thomas potentially looking 22 years prison , dumbfounded . “ But Miss Gierhart , ” remembers saying , “ I ’ never even done jail time. ” She told best . “ And said , ‘ Well , O.K. , ’ thanked . He really extraordinary client — always kind , courteous , regular courtesy , gentle. ” She credits connection grandmother . In prison , Thomas called Willie Jane every Sunday morning — anyone else phoned waited call , scolded whoever occupying line : “ You know boy ’ calling today ! ” In ways , though , prison changed Thomas . “ He went blaming problems world , ” says father , Ricardo Foster . “ But came realize one hurting . He really grew up. ” Thomas befriended older inmates , mentored . He took responsibility son , born shortly Thomas indicted . He worked , dropping size 52 waist size 36 . He talked much wished boys young men Saginaw would quit killing one another . Twice year , Thomas ’ father drove Detroit home , picked Willie Jane Thomas ’ son made six-hour trip prison could visit . Thomas ’ mentors told President Obama soliciting clemency applications nonviolent offenders , help reverse decades harsh sentencing . Clemency , Obama wrote , one step “ restore degree justice , fairness proportionality system. ” Just Thanksgiving 2016 — eight years prison behind 11 go — Thomas learned president commuted sentence 78 inmates , noted probably would received much shorter terms convicted administration . In letter Thomas , Obama wrote : “ You demonstrated potential turn life around . Now make opportunity. ” Gierhart , haunted Thomas ’ long sentence , sobbed heard would soon free . A year Thomas ’ sentence commuted , grandmother learned cancer spread lungs . “ My mom really , really sick , ” Thomas ’ mother says . “ I feed , take bathroom , put wheelchair . But heard DeMarlon coming home , things . She could stand , could walk , times even cooked him. ” On Dec. 13 , 2016 , age 31 , Thomas moved Saginaw halfway house , allowed several hours day part reintegration .

Early morning , texted friends family . “ Love , ” would write . “ Enjoy life. ” “ Have great day. ” And course , visited grandmother . On Jan. 23 , less six weeks Thomas left prison , two masked men carrying semiautomatic assault rifles burst halfway house unsecured door . One held inmates employees gunpoint ; shot Thomas multiple times close range . The police called execution .

But , told read Judith Guest novel adapting , ’ stop picturing Moore Beth . Redford home Malibu , sometimes ’ look beach see taking walks . She seemed like sad figure walks , different spunky triumphant walks took opening credits “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show. ” He told important role film . He wanted someone play sympathetically . Moore agreed emphatically . Beth reminded Moore father . She also little Beth — would realize eventually . She told Redford ’ think Beth villain another victim story . Moore called “ Ordinary People ” “ holy grail ” career , remarkable script production , Oscar nomination earned , saved eternal typecasting needed . She good sitcoms . But ? She early 40s , seemed sentenced life short-lived series celebrity guest appearances sitcoms game shows . Depth mood range ’ things people associated . When “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show ” debuted 1970 , one could predicted iconic would become way portrayed women ’ experiences workplace , way heroine , Mary Richards , remained plucky face discrimination , passive aggressive . That back plucky seemed like good solution constant insults merely trying function female , smiling moxie crap thrown direction seemed like best way survive advance . Mary Richards struck exact balance wit intelligence kind wise understanding people ’ natures . She perfect guide navigating a-wokening corporate American man ( project still ongoing , say least ) . The show ’ cultural impact seven years monumental . Mary Richards allowed women ask questions loud exactly hoping life , important marry families build important sustaining families ’ born .

In 1980 , Gloria Steinem asked Moore speak Equal Rights Amendment rally Washington . Moore said yes , time came , lied said ear infection ’ fly . Steinem suggested take train instead . She told Moore Tip O ’ Neill , speaker House , agreed meet Steinem ’ group — Bella Abzug , Gloria Allred , etc . — Moore attendance . So Moore took train , begrudgingly , roped four-hour trip instead hourlong flight . She showed meeting submitted “ big hug ” O ’ Neill demanded . ( “ Where ’ little cutie ? ” remembered saying . ) But waste time . The amendment stalled , found women rallying equal rights well intentioned intelligent off-putting , shouting , like “ angry children. ” This , believed , one reason amendment ultimately failed become law . Yes , saw paradox . Yes , loved Mary Richards , . But ’ women America know exhausting aspire Mary Richards ? So , years show went air . She told people ended could go top , real reason producers , writers Tinker , co-founded production company , MTM Enterprises , saw much potential spinoffs — “ Rhoda , ” “ Lou Grant ” others — seemed like smart move . Great bottom line , yes , Moore ? She Maryisms , called — referring movements speech patterns absorbed manner many years playing Mary Richards . She theater , including playing quadriplegic wants end life , “ Whose Life Is It , Anyway ? ” raves special Tony . Then came Redford ’ offer . But ’ really offer , end . After spoke first time , took three months consider right role , auditioning every actress town , Moore heard . When finally returned , saying , Yes , please , come Beth Jarrett , nearly fell relief . Now could show something big audience ’ always . She afraid people would find ’ Mary Richards . But time waited Redford ’ offer , realized afraid ’ ; afraid ’ never seen known loved . Redford continued try get shot Beth cake , never . It appears nowhere movie . Moore said later believed Redford looking Beth ’ soul . But Beth ’ kind person reveal soul . Beth kind person would rather give cake smile . She could mourn overcoming sadness lifelong pursuit perfectionism . Beth ’ soul act showing soul . How Redford see ? How Redford see Beth ’ soul right front entire time ? In elegant uptown apartment , unhappy doctor bushy eyebrows formal bearing went sleep night feeling like pretender . In morning , knew , another batch wincing patients desperate relief would waiting see . And knew , despite training Ivy League degree , nothing meaningful offer . John Sarno rehabilitation-medicine specialist N.Y.U. , taught — diagnosing pinched nerves slipped disks , recommending hot pads bed rest . But months passed , advice gave patients left feeling increasingly bitter . They pain , lost . Around time , started seeing therapist , “ learn psyche. ” He devoured psychology books began see physical ailments — irritable stomach , itchy skin , shrieking headaches — manifestations emotional well-being . He wondered understanding pain might offer insight patients ’ problems . As squeezed pressed patients ’ sore backs , asked medical history ; migraines irritable stomachs common . There searching questions : Are sensitive criticism ? Why put much pressure ? Do think ’ good mother ? From answers , theory took shape : His patients ’ pain real , ’ really caused slipped disks , pinched nerves old football injuries . Instead , body using physical pain defend mental anguish disappointing career , combative marriage .

One expresses gratitude “ giving new life go with. ” Another says : “ Whenever I feel slight twinge , I remind nothing really wrong neck . Thank , Dr. Sarno , changing life. ” Most doctors still dismiss Sarno ’ views , understanding pain remains medicine ’ fringe . I , however , count among believers . Some 15 years ago , I 20s , I terrible back pain , eminent doctor recommended I spinal surgery . On relative ’ recommendation , I went see Sarno second opinion . Limping office , I found tiny , owlish man sitting behind giant wooden desk . It looked lab coat might swallow , leaving behind pair heavy , dark-rimmed glasses . He asked I come see , I described problems back life . He kind inquisitive firm . He seen people like . There ’ nothing wrong , said . Don ’ surgery . Stop acting sick . Your back fine , .

And Sarno , irritated skin solitary lunches , would first acknowledge never conquered . “ I furious ! ” said . “ It ’ time !

Five films taken $ 300 million — two typical — anticipated giants way , including Pixar sequel “ Finding Dory ” “ Star Trek Beyond. ” And yet Champagne corks popping Hollywood . Why ? For start , big-budget sequels , typically safest route box office success , generated ragged holiday weekend sales . “ X-Men : Apocalypse ” ( 20th Century Fox ) took estimated $ 65 million Friday Sunday , 29 percent less initial results franchise predecessor . The film delivered sixth best opening among eight “ X-Men ” movies , taking inflation account . Bombing “ Alice Through Looking Glass , ” cost Walt Disney Studios $ 170 million make . It took $ 28.1 million , according comScore , compiles box office data . “ We ’ obviously frustrated disappointed , ” said Dave Hollis , Disney ’ executive vice president distribution . “ Alice Wonderland ” arrived $ 127 million domestic ticket sales 2010 , adjusting inflation . But misgivings Hollywood extend beyond one disappointing weekend , even one important Memorial Day . A troubling box office trend started last summer become pronounced : The riches flowing evenly — four six major movie factories struggling — expensive event films seem drawing crowds , many general purpose , middle-tier movies virtually ignored despite aggressive marketing .

Let know else ’ heard along lines . By time S. Allen Counter got Greenland 1986 , already lived many lives — Harvard neurophysiologist , explorer , ethnographer , social-justice advocate . But howling hinterland , man possessed ghost powerful followed icy hell . And Counter ’ believe good fortune : privilege freezing igloo among Inuit , eating walrus heart kiviaq , little winged auks fermented sealskin . He giddy , set blank space , searching justice dead black man whose story lost snowdrift white history . Counter , friend wrote , “ interesting man world. ” Born Americus , Ga. , grew Boynton Beach West Palm Beach , Fla. , community full fruit-pickers maids servants , support resort town wealthy whites living seaside mansions like Mar-a-Lago . Jim Crow fact life — segregated schools , beaches , train-station waiting rooms — least one law , West Palm could considered progressive : African-Americans allowed businesses , long part town catered African-Americans . Even boy , Counter could remember participating “ wade-in , ” blacks appeared all-white beach swim ocean . His awareness charged physical social spaces heightened matured , moved seamlessly worlds — black , white , — unafraid inquisitive . After college , earned Ph.D. communication , went Sweden get medical degree . He taught prison inmates , research brain injuries took expeditions Andes study lead mercury poisoning mountain communities . At one point , traveled villages descendants slaves Suriname . Energetic , persuasive , ambitious deep listener , Counter hobnobbed presidents , celebrities royalty . His Rolodex thing wonder , used organize trips Louisiana Haiti aftermath storms earthquakes . Once , returned home Boynton Beach , arrival heralded front-page news . Soon enough , according friend ’ recollection , phone rang grandmother ’ house , old employers line , white rich never interested , asking grandson would come visit . It founding director Harvard Foundation Intercultural Race Relations Counter perhaps found powerful voice , trying improve relations racial ethnic groups campus . He stood Peter Gomes , black minister Harvard announced gay . He stood idea Palestinians Jews , Harvard , must find rapprochement . And initiated Portraiture Project , commissioning paintings people color , join college ’ walls symbolizing status-quo white privilege . The faces matter , believed , ones looking history . There one face conspicuously absent history books , though . As boy , Counter heard story explorer named Matthew Henson , African-American accompanied Adm. Robert Peary expeditions 1891 1909 explore Greenland try first reach North Pole . Henson sometimes described Peary ’ “ manservant ” shared close unusual relationship Peary , given racism era . He made invaluable Arctic North well , repairing sledges , hunting communicating directly Inuit . As Peary plotted last attempt 1909 , convinced best approach would start large party scramble final stretch small one . Peary sent members back toward Roosevelt , ship , without warning . But Henson remained . The rest crew understood importance . “ Peary knew Matt Henson ’ real worth , ” expedition member Donald MacMillan wrote later . Henson “ real value commander Bartlett , Marvin , Borup , Goodsell put together . Matthew Henson went pole Peary better man one us. ” What happened pole — agree group proximity pole , perhaps exactly — matter controversy decades ( especially given fact Frederick Cook also claimed North Pole , days Peary ’ telegram reached America ) . It became subject congressional hearings time fodder barrage headlines . Only Henson , along four Inuit , accompanied Peary . They claimed made excellent time clear , cold weather . Henson , 10 years Peary ’ junior , still fine fettle . Peary , old man 52 , suffered effects previous frostbite loss eight toes . Eventually , confusion whether ’ gone far , returned place Peary ’ readings determined North Pole , Henson would later claim Peary found — Henson ’ — footsteps . To emphasize : That would put black man top world first . But months later , Peary ’ telegram reached public — “ Stars Stripes nailed Pole ” — went Henson ’ place story , relegated invisibility . While Peary eventually gathered accolades , awards remuneration due Arctic explorer day — hailed white explorer brought white America glory sought global stage — Henson went working parking-lot attendant messenger Customs House New York . Only end life partially recognized feats , thanks book “ Dark Companion , ” Bradley Robinson , told story . What ’ tell part stuck Allen Counter , however , fond unerasing erased , putting discrimination higher use , hauling hidden bright light . Peary Henson taken called “ Inuit wives , ” unabashed practice polar explorers , children : Peary , two sons ; Henson , one . Those children existed somewhere Greenland . Could one recover part Matthew Henson ’ dignity finding ? To look back , realize similar Henson Counter actually , possession might taken place . Each socially gifted , exceptionally hardworking structurally instrumental communities , traveling long miles uncomplainingly result . When Counter arrived Moriusaq , tiny village top Baffin Bay , meet Henson ’ son , Anaukaq , son — old man — insisted Counter must Henson . “ I often wondered whether curious urge search Matthew Henson ’ descendants way might based unknown biological kinship Henson family , ” Counter would write book “ North Pole Legacy. ” The events followed attributed pure force Counter . By submarine helicopter , dog sled transport jet , space became compressed , lines scumbled , people different language background pressed meeting . Counter brought two abandoned Inuit sons United States , American brethren . Through series letters , including President Ronald Reagan , Counter called United States recognize Matthew Henson ’ achievement disinterring body , along wife ’ , Woodlawn Cemetery Bronx burying next Robert Peary Arlington National Cemetery . To desegregate history . At ceremony , American Inuit descendants sizable crowd — black , white others — attendance . Emotions ran high . From bones old explorers emerged new world . “ We become one big family , ” Counter later wrote . And ’ wishful thinking . At end school day Irina Ratushinskaya fifth grader 1960s Odessa , teacher stepped class exuberant student seized moment throw chestnut across room . The chestnut landed inkwell broke , splattering ink . Seeing damage , children hastily packed left , Ratushinskaya another student , boy named Seryozha , charge cleaning classroom school day stay . A teacher came , discovered broken inkwell asked done . Ratushinskaya lied hedged : “ I ’ know , I ’ see anything , happened I searching something satchel. ” But turn , Seryozha simply said , “ I ’ going tell you. ” His answer revelation . “ It ’ even entered head say , ” writes second two memoirs Soviet dissent , “ In Beginning ” ( 1991 ) . “ How ashamed I felt ! How much liking answer mine ! ” A poet became anti-Soviet activist 20s , Ratushinskaya among last wave dissidents whose efforts helped bring Soviet Union . In years harassed , arrested , tried , imprisoned tortured Soviets , would get far versions I ’ going tell . The daughter engineer schoolteacher , started writing poems child . At university , boyfriend surprised learn never read great poets Russia ’ Silver Age . He brought illegal volumes Marina Tsvetayeva , Anna Akhmatova Osip Mandelstam . Reading , Ratushinskaya made two galling discoveries : one , Soviets denied students generation knowledge great work ; , poems , unconsciously echoed Russian modernist gestures without understanding . The poets may banned , fragments work drifted culture . Ratushinskaya vowed scrap “ unknowingly stolen black horses , weeping accordions , white swans gypsies ” start . She met students quietly writing poetry gave copies work anyone interested . She ’ sure happened left hands , next 10 years , would regularly meet people knew poems . She interest becoming officially recognized poet , would required publish poems praise Soviet Union . Instead , worked schoolteacher , lab technician physics tutor . At risk arrest , ( later husband , Igor Gerashchenko ) also made distributed copies writers ’ work : labor-camp memoirs political writing well fiction poetry . “ Samizdat prestigious ‘ publisher ’ world author , ” wrote “ In Beginning. ” Work ’ good “ drops circulation quickly : Why anyone risk years imprisonment reading rubbish ? ” Her poems traveled widely knew , would learn arrested K.G.B . 1982 . She sentenced seven years Mordovia prison camp complex , provincial region 300 miles southeast Moscow ; one camps remained open political prisoners . When time board prison transport train Kiev Mordovia , Ratushinskaya received usual ration half loaf black bread herring . Having read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn ’ “ The Gulag Archipelago , ” knew eat herring : “ It makes terribly thirsty , nothing drink. ” In “ Gulag , ” history Soviet labor-camp system , Anne Applebaum describes development , decades , prisoners ’ political consciousness : growing organization , solidarity rebelliousness among camp inmates led stage work strikes , protests hunger strikes . Whereas 1930s prisoners ordinary Soviet citizens bewildered ashamed find arrested , prisoners postwar post-Stalin eras likely former soldiers partisans Western republics , experienced organized resistance . The early 1960s saw publication Solzhenitsyn ’ novel camp life , “ One Day Life Ivan Denisovich , ” well memoirs former prisoners , widely read Soviet society much chip away perceived legitimacy regime . In 1960s many prisoners active dissidents , 1970s , also contacts sympathizers West . In 1983 , Ratushinskaya sentenced , joining network political prisoners well-developed methods smuggling information free society . When met four women whose prison barracks would sharing , Ratushinskaya recognized names Western radio broadcasts . They well-known dissidents admired . “ Gray Is Color Hope ” ( 1988 ) , memoir three years gulag , describes hunger strikes , force-feedings punitive stays solitary confinement also intense camaraderie political prisoners , made point treating humanely inhumane conditions . Ratushinskaya ’ two memoirs , effect , books free even authority recognize rights . When free , write poems without permission . You risk comfort safety attend demonstrations .

The Soviet Western publics lost interest dissidents fall Soviet Union . Their skills ’ seem translate post-Soviet political landscape , point tactical knowledge experience empire fell ? Seen struggle totalitarianism , efforts seemed belong history . But seen broadly struggle corruption abuse power , example may use . Dr. Joseph Nicolosi ’ take gay answer . It 2012 , Alan Chambers , Nicolosi ’ friend fellow leader ex-gay movement , causing trouble telling truth . During speeches television appearances , Chambers admitted still attracted men , “ 99.9 percent ” people unwanted same-sex attractions ’ change conversion therapy — sometimes called reparative therapy — often psychologically harmful , particularly teenagers . After public denunciation industry helped build , Nicolosi , clinical psychologist believed male same-sex attraction developmental disorder caused childhood trauma gender confusion , called Chambers phone . “ If ’ come therapy , I fix , ” Nicolosi insisted . “ I cure this. ” But Chambers happy . “ I ’ say : ‘ Joe , ’ promise cure people . That ’ going happen , I even want happen. ’ ” As tense conversations , Chambers could never manage dislike old friend , gruff , offbeat New Yorker could “ cuss wallpaper wall ” whose brashness rubbed many people wrong way . “ He prima donna , sure , also breath fresh air ” conservative Christian world inhabited , Chambers told . Nicolosi stood many ways , including Catholic personal connection L.G.B.T . issues . While many ex-gay movement either struggling same-sex attractions family member seemingly , Nicolosi ostensibly heterosexual professed come reparative therapy intellectual scientific perspective . He counseled adults teenagers office Encino , Calif. , mahogany shelves featured several books , including “ A Parent ’ Guide Preventing Homosexuality ” “ Healing Homosexuality. ” ( They jam-packed falsehoods absurdities , including passages like “ Two men never take full open manner ” “ Growing straight something happens . It requires good parenting. ” ) One Nicolosi ’ teenage patients late 1990s Gabriel Arana , 14 agreed parents ’ request try reparative therapy . “ Nicolosi clear narrative coming life , ” Arana recalls . “ My mom controlling , dad underinvolved . And I overidentified mom I ’ feel masculine , source attractions. ” Arana ’ mind weekly sessions Nicolosi , remembers warm nonshaming , even Arana confessed therapy ’ appear working . “ When I told I still meeting gay boys internet , said feel guilty . He tried position supportive father thought clients ’ have. ” Some 15 years later , Arana — journalist long accepted sexuality — called former therapist article working ex-gay movement . Nicolosi expressed surprise Arana “ went gay direction ” shocked Arana asking wanted try therapy . “ That shows deluded , ” Arana told . That delusion caused Nicolosi see transformation none . Ryan Kendall , another former teenage client Nicolosi , blames therapy years depression suicidal feelings , remembers day Nicolosi introduced one supposed success stories . “ He trots 25-year-old named Kelly , I remember finding attractive , ” Kendall recalls . “ When Nicolosi ’ room , guy says , ‘ I ’ parents want , I ’ going gay bar later. ’ ” When Nicolosi died March age 70 , tears shed L.G.B.T . community . ( “ Has tried *not* dead ? ” typical reaction Twitter . ) But , like Arana , surprised feelings former therapist ’ death evoked . “ I felt strange need defend , ” Arana told . “ Part wonders ’ Stockholm syndrome even years later . But evil people ex-gay movement , I ’ see one . However terrible harmful ideas , believed sincerely ignored — whether consciously — evidence contrary . I think ’ counterproductive portray total villain. ” So Nicolosi understood ? According son , Joseph Nicolosi Jr. , Nicolosi believed sexuality “ ’ something set stone people ” merely “ describing sexual fluidity 40 years became accepted. ” But Wayne Besen , gay activist longtime foe Nicolosi ex-gay industry , Nicolosi enigma . “ What motivated ? ” Besen wonders . “ Was opportunism ? Catholicism ? A personal issue ? Nobody could really figure out. ” Whatever Nicolosi ’ motivations , Besen calls “ important destructive ” figure reparative-therapy community , Nicolosi — Ph.D. psychology founder National Association Research & Therapy Homosexuality — bolstered movement veneer scientific respectability . “ He essentially say , ‘ You may believe Jesus cure , ’ science , ’ ” Besen says . “ It fake science , used misinformation well. ” Nicolosi ’ death comes precarious time ex-gay movement . Most once-formidable organizations ( including Exodus International , Love Won Out Jonah ) closed , several former ex-gay leaders apologized accepted gay identity . Still , gay men desperate change — parents desperate change children — ’ without options . Only nine states District Columbia ban conversion therapy minors , people practice days operate radar state regulators . Charles Francis , president Mattachine Society Washington , D.C. , L.G.B.T . history society , warns ex-gay movement quietly rebranding . “ Nicolosi horse buggy compared ’ coming way conversion therapy cover First Amendment religious liberty , ” Francis predicts . But Besen ’ sure . “ The industry corpse , shell former self , ” told . “ We ’ laid robust record proves beyond doubt reparative therapy ’ work , fact damaging . It ’ joke fraud , everybody realizes . It ’ bad Nicolosi never . ” The Television Academy announced nominees 68th Emmy Awards earlier Thursday .

The special effects pretty cool , film working nostalgia already thoroughly mined movies ( including video-game-themed “ Wreck-It Ralph ” ) television ( “ The Goldbergs ” ) . So ’ original wants , despite able Chris Columbus director ’ chair . When story shifts New York climactic battle , unlikely saviors might call mind “ Ghostbusters ” gang — another 1980s reference — make wish film wry freshness original installment franchise . I trying find something original say “ Mad Men ” finale , debate week ’ episode “ Game Thrones ” turned interesting mysteries Don Draper . It even roped United States Senator , Claire McCaskill , announced intention give watching “ Thrones ” Sunday ’ show concluded ( spoiler , spoiler , spoiler , SPOILER ) wedding-night rape Sansa Stark , often-menaced daughter show ’ heroic beleaguered family , hands sadistic loathsome member show ’ dramatis personae , Ramsay Bolton . McCaskill one many viewers moved outrage ( ) scene , particular outcry among feminist critics raised issues show ’ portrait rape sexual violence past . Which turn prompted counterpoints various writers , defended seriousness show treats sexual violence noted particular outrage strange place draw line . Sonny Bunch Free Beacon made latter point vivid catalogue horrors viewers watched unfold prior particular rape ( “ woman sold sexual slavery deadbeat brother … [ ] raped literally first episodes show … A pregnant woman stabbed womb 57 times way punish man broke vow marry psychopath ’ daughter … ” etc . ) , Washington Post Alyssa Rosenberg argued show always telling “ story consequences rape denial sexual autonomy ” ’ “ odd ” angry viewers “ accuse showrunners adding sexual assault somehow stakes … intimate violence already core many series ’ storylines. ” These reasonable points , viewer show ’ always conflicted treatment sex violence let say word defense Sansa Stark outrage . Three words , fact : First , ’ odd strange question motives “ Game Thrones ” showrunners , since , fact , persistent habit adding extra assaults outrages story ’ adapting “ stakes ” jolt audience ; indeed , ’ added entire characters ( prostitute-turned-madam , nubile young noblewoman ) George R.R . Martin ’ story order subject ( plus latter ’ unborn child ) extraordinarily brutal fates . The show also habit showing , indeed lingering , scenes torture ( sexual otherwise ) take place offstage hinted books , playing sadism already sadistic characters , like Prince/King Joffrey Bolton , Sansa ’ violator . Sometimes clear dramatic purpose changes additions , I think particular case addition made little sense others ( though one argue clumsily executed ) , narrowed Martin ’ sprawling narrative added urgency plotlines wandering unfocused books . ( In novels , different girl suffers Sansa ’ fate worse Bolton ’ hands , I recall torture described directly shown . ) But quite often changes piece show ’ frequent use “ sexposition ” random brothel scenes nudity quotient : They ’ mostly shock way non-violent sex scenes mostly titillate , clear narrative purpose secondary , broad thematic elements Rosenberg ( correctly ) identifies would survive fine without . Now one , admittedly , also identify brutal scenes novels excised show . But second point comes : The image simply different word , describe particular act different depicting , aesthetic moral perspective . The power film lies realism immediacy ; ’ medium effective re-creation , real people enact ’ portrayed viewer given illusion experiencing story firsthand enfleshed . So sense implicated ’ happening story , even participating somehow , almost always stronger on-screen adaptation book ’ based , even two stories identical shape , artist adaptation reckon fact . Which say books pornographic exploitative ; course . But experience different , threshold different , audience reaction inevitably different well . So ’ enough defend whatever H.B.O . adaptation depicts saying , well , ’ worse stuff Martin ’ books , matter , well , ’ worse stuff actual medieval history . What Barbara Tuchman readers described rapine pillage “ A Distant Mirror ” “ Games Thrones ” — — viewers shows people raped murdered categorically different ways storytelling . And ’ inconsistent criticize show shows shows declining outraged similar events described printed page . Finally , yes , scale outrages show depicted one seem perfectly logical place draw line say “ ! ” But reactions art , moral reactions included , mysterious . Clearly issues sympathy work : Sansa central , favorably-portrayed younger character women suffered show , ’ someone many viewers relate strongly victims . And probably issues particular cultural moment , particularly campus rape debate , make kind scene seem “ problematic , ” “ triggering ” , certain critics show ’ exploitative moments . You argue reactions unsound ; reflect bias toward young pretty ; stronger moral critique show would encompass torture-porn porn-porn elements rather focusing sexual violence alone . But ’ dealing entertainment makes morally uncomfortable , I ’ think ’ rule says ’ quit show lesser outrage ’ already accepted larger one . Sometimes ’ straw , boulder , breaks … well , know . I ’ saying , incidentally , tell anyone quit watching happened Sansa . I still watching Sunday night , I judge ? But prestige drama I ’ obsessed , “ Game Thrones ” fandom makes , least , morally uneasy .

With fealty Martin novels mitigating aggravating problems open-ended storytelling continuing series face , “ Game Thrones ” seem vivid diffuse , simultaneously exciting excruciating : ever going get ? And even generous budget accorded showcase HBO production , advance narrative express ideas mainly dialogue — endless conversations around tables campfires , horseback prison cells .
